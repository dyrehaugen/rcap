These are not easy policies. But <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Prosperity-without-Growth-Foundations-for-the-Economy-of-Tomorrow/Jackson/p/book/9781138935419">prosperity without growth</a> is the defining challenge for twenty-first century economics, and better ideas are welcome.</p>
<p>The idea of continuous growth is relatively recent, a product of the New Deal, when GDP was invented to help governments manage the economy. The Soviets first set annual growth targets in the 1950s, with the OECD following on and kick-starting an era of “growthmanship.” Growth is now like a secular god, a doxa whose truth cannot be questioned, left or right, east or west.</p>

<p>Basic material needs have been satisfied - we need something else not more of the same!</p>
<p>The idea is fundamentally different from a recession since
degrowth is a planned reduction of energy and resource use.
A recession, however, is an unplanned event that can exacerbate inequality and reduce wellbeing.</p>
<p>Why does it matter?
In one word: climate.
On our current trajectory climate change endangers roughly half of all plants and all insect species,
as well as a quarter of vertebrate species, within the century.</p>
<p>The current economic system sacrifices both people and environments at a time when everything from shifting weather patterns to rising sea levels is global in scope and unprecedented in nature.
We have a system that is not only not delivering social benefits, it is also accelerating planetary disasters,</p>

<div id="ecosocialism-vs-degrowth" class="section level2" number="18.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.1</span> Ecosocialism vs Degrowth</h2>
<p>Ecosocialists agree that a significant measure of de-growth in production and consumption is necessary in order to avoid ecological collapse. But they have a critical assessment of the de-growth theories because: a) the concept of “de-growth” is insufficient to define an alternative programme; b) it does not make clear if de-growth can be achieved in the framework of capitalism or not; c) it does not distinguish between activities that need to be reduced and those that need to be developed.</p>
<p>Serge Latouche, who is well known worldwide, is one of the most controversial French de-growth theoreticians. For sure, some of his arguments are legitimate: demystification of “sustainable development,” critique of the religion of growth and “progress,” call for a cultural revolution.</p>
<p><em>A qualitative transformation of development</em>.</p>
<p>Putting an end to the monstrous waste of resources by capitalism, based on the production, on a large scale, of useless and/or harmful products: the armaments industry is a good example, but a great part of the “goods” produced in capitalism, with their inbuilt obsolescence, have no other usefulness but to generate profit for the big corporations. The issue is not “excessive consumption” in the abstract, but the prevalent type of consumption, based as it is on conspicuous acquisition, massive waste, mercantile alienation, obsessive accumulation of goods, and the compulsive purchase of pseudo-novelties imposed by “fashion.”</p>
<p>How to distinguish the authentic from the artificial, factitious (artificially created) and makeshift needs? The last ones are induced by mental manipulation, i.e. advertisement. The advertising system has invaded all spheres of human life in modern capitalist societies.
While advertisement is an indispensable dimension of the capitalist market economy, it would have no place in a society in transition to socialism, where it would be replaced by information on goods and services provided by consumer associations.</p>
<p>Compulsive acquisitiveness is induced by the commodity fetishism inherent in the capitalist system, by the dominant ideology and by advertisement: nothing proves that it is part of an “eternal human nature.”</p>

<div id="without-growth---ecological-socialism" class="section level2" number="18.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.2</span> Without Growth - Ecological Socialism</h2>
<p>Degrowth redefines progress.
The goal is to achieve well-being for all,
in balance with the Earth’s ecosystems,
and any step we take in this direction (i.e., degrowth) represents progress.</p>
<p>Degrowth is as anti-capitalist as it gets!</p>
<p>The ideology of growth has become the powerhouse of modern capitalism and we do not understand why some socialists are reluctant to join the battle against a phenomenon that is socially divisive and ecologically unsustainable. A socialism without growth but with well-being as its goal is how we reconcile two of the most powerful concepts we have: capitalism and guaranteeing a future.</p>
<p>As is evident by now, we do use the C-word, a lot. Certain Marxist commentators have accused degrowth of never explicitly questioning capitalism. Phillips (2015 depicts degrowth as a “small-scale steady-state capitalism.” The degrowth project some would think resembles the film Downsizing (2017), where exuberant consumerism is made environmentally possible by shrinking people down to a few centimetres.</p>
<p>So, let us be clear: degrowth is not miniature capitalism with tiny corporations, tiny speculative financial instruments, and tiny free trade agreements. It is not austerity within capitalism. It is an alternative system of provision altogether – not just smaller and slower, but different.</p>
<p>You may ask why focus on growth and not just capitalism? Well, try to compare the occurrence of “economic growth” versus “capital accumulation” in the news. As Gareth Dale has forcefully argued, economic growth is the ideology that has turned the specific interest of capital to grow (for returns, and for keeping social peace) into a generalized social objective assimilated by the population. This is not an ideology that will go away by refusing to confront it or beautifying it with nice adjectives. The fact that this ideology survived even the end of capitalism (or at least of a certain type of capitalism) in ex-socialist regimes should give pause for thought. Socialists who defend growth must also think twice whether they are redwashing capital, redressing the dreams that capitalism sells as socialist dreams.</p>
<p>Growth is the child of capitalism, but the child grew up and took over the head of the family. Capitalism’s interest in accumulation is promoted and legitimised through – and in the name of – “growth.” The critique of growth is the most fundamental critique of capitalism – one that criticises not only the means capitalism uses but the very ends it sells. This makes degrowth and (eco)socialism natural allies, not adversaries.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.3</span> Less Production - Better Distribution</h2>
<p>If capitalism calls for scarcity in order to generate more growth, degrowth calls for the opposite: reversing artificial scarcities in order to remove growthist pressures, and indeed to render additional growth unnecessary. Expanding universal public services is key to this (i.e., the opposite of austerity). As for the problem of excess throughput: this is being driven by unnecessary industrial activity (in other words, industrial activity that is organized around exchange-value rather than use-value) and elite accumulation. So that’s what we have to degrow.</p>
<p>Of course, one can imagine this being achieved by an authoritarian government, but it wouldn’t work very well. The problem with any elitist state structure is that it is removed from the complex realities of regional ecology. You can’t manage ecosystems with abstract planning (James Scott’s work in Seeing Like a State is good on this); it requires the knowledge of people who have a relationship with the land… it requires commoners. We know that when people have collective democratic control over local ecological commons they make decisions to sustain rather than liquidate them. That’s the principle we need to build on.</p>
<p>Our relationship with nature will mimic the structure of our society. If we organize society around hierarchy, domination and extraction (which is true of both capitalism and any form of authoritarianism), then our relationship with nature will be hierarchical, dominating and extractive. But if we organize society around egalitarianism, reciprocity and care, then our relationship with nature will be egalitarian, reciprocal and caring. Every human society necessarily relies on nonhuman species; the question is, according to what principles do we incorporate them?</p>
<p>Degrowthism strikes a path that incorporates high-tech solutions
to build low-tech, low-harm economies.</p>
<p>Under capitalism, innovations that deliver efficiency improvements lead not to a reduction of energy and resource use, but rather to more energy and resource use, because the gains are reinvested to expand the process of production and consumption. In other words, growthism wipes out our most impressive improvements. When it comes to confronting ecological breakdown, we must realize that it’s not our technology that’s the problem, it’s growth.</p>
<p><em>Action</em></p>
<p>The first step is to amplify the voices of Indigenous leaders and activists who are already pointing in this direction. The Red Nation movement’s tagline says “All Relatives Forever,” with relatives here of course referring to both human and nonhuman persons. Consider the implications of such a politics; it is profound – far more radical, and far more inspiring and enriching, than traditional leftist discourse.</p>
<p>The Rights of Nature movement is also promising; the more we talk about rivers, watersheds and ecosystems as persons, with rights to existence, the more this idea becomes thinkable. We don’t have to wait for national governments to create such rights; in many places local councils have this power.</p>
<p><em>Fiction</em></p>
<p>Ursula Le Guin’s The Dispossessed. It’s a story about a kind of ecosocialist society on another planet. The premise is that the ecosystem is primarily desert, so people have to find ways to sustain a flourishing society with relatively little material throughput. They do it with a firm commitment to egalitarianism, public goods, and direct democracy. They fiercely reject elite accumulation, which they see as dangerously wasteful. Because they do not measure civilization in terms of the quantity of stuff they consume (as our society does), they are free to focus on higher goals: philosophy, science and art. It’s worth noting that Le Guin was the daughter of Alfred Kroeber, an anthropologist who spent his career learning from Indigenous communities in the American Southwest. These were people who saw egalitarianism and direct democracy as essential to survival in a desert ecosystem. Le Guin was clearly inspired by their approach to the world.</p>
<p>There’s other literature that deals with degrowth themes, although without trying to portray a degrowth society. Michael Ende’s Momo comes to mind. There’s also Hayao Miyazaki’s films. Aldous Huxley’s Island. David Graeber’s Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology explores ethnographic insights that are relevant to degrowth theory. Then there are the writings of anti-colonial leaders like Gandhi, Fanon and Sankara, who rejected growthism and sought to define a more human-centered economics. These are all resources we can draw on as we imagine a more just and ecological civilization.</p>
<p><em>Strategy</em></p>
<p>There’s a lot of work to be done when it comes to degrowth political strategy. I think what’s required is a range of approaches. There are people at the community level working to bring degrowth principles to local economic governance. Transition Towns in the UK are a nascent example of this. So too with cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen adopting “doughnut economics.” We can see it at a national level, too, with New Zealand, Scotland and Iceland choosing to abandon GDP growth as a government objective. I think there’s hope at a multilateral level, too: the Environment Committee of the European Parliament just recently voted in favour of binding targets to reduce material throughput in absolute terms. That’s a core degrowth policy. Of course, it’s not law yet – but it’s a huge step.</p>
<p>The difference between neoliberal political strategy and degrowth is that the former had the backing of billionaires and corporations that bankrolled think tanks, university departments, and media outlets. It also had international financial institutions and the US military, which forcibly imposed the Washington Consensus around the world. Degrowth has to rely almost entirely on social movements. That’s a tall order, but we can take inspiration from our ancestors: the anti-slavery movement, the anti-apartheid movement, the anti-colonial movement, the Civil Rights Movement, the labour movement, the feminist movement… all of these have changed the world, against overwhelming odds. That’s the scale of what’s required of us.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">18.6</span> Assimilating Degrowth</h2>
<p><em>Trantas</em></p>
<p>The sustainable development discourse, including the modern green growth version, may have aspects that contribute to environmental and social welfare but it is a top down reform project, that aims at correcting the environmental and social externalities resulting from economic growth. It is directed by governments that abide by the logic of capital. Although in principle there is civic engagement, public participation is limited and without challenging the dominant economic paradigm. Following Gramsci’s terminology, sustainable development can be interpreted as a passive revolution, in the sense that change is managed through compromises with different social and political actors but within limits which neutralize any potential threat to economic and political power. On the contrary, the emerging (yet still marginal) alternative, multi-disciplinary, degrowth academic paradigm, has evolved from an activist movement since the first decade of this century, and retains close contacts and open communication with social movements that support a degrowth transition in economy and society. This transition directly challenges the established orthodox growth narrative and the mechanisms of capital accumulation. Thus, in contrast to the sustainable development discourse, it is difficult for the “power bloc” to accommodate degrowth. But in times of crisis and change, the dominant powers can certainly use some aspects of the degrowth discourse, assimilating and transforming them into elements that fit their new accumulation strategies, hegemonic visions and state projects. For this not to happen, degrowthers should focus their research and theory more on the workings of capitalist political economy, and their political practice on trying to form alliances with social actors, such as working-class movements,that are crucial for the achievement of hegemony.</p>
<p><strong>Passive Revolution (Gramsci)</strong></p>
<p>Passive revolution then is about trying “to manage change
and maintain control of economic and political power through compromises with different social interests and
political forces within limits which neutralise anything which presents a serious threat”</p>
<p>In
a passive revolution, the interests of the dominant forces are imposed on the popular masses “through a war of
position which advances particular popular interests (if at all) through a mechanical game of compromise rather
than their organic integration into a ‘national-popular’ project”</p>
<p>This differs from an
expansive hegemony, as the latter requires the active support of the people to a hegemonic vision (and state
project) 5 , on the basis of symbolic and material rewards that the popular masses receive in a national–popular
program, which aims to advance not only the immediate “corporate” interests of the dominant group, but a very
broad coalition of forces, ideally the whole nation.</p>
<p>This is a basic precondition for forming a “historical bloc,”
which is about the “unity between structure and superstructure” and the formation of a homogeneous politico-
economic alliance, without internal contradictions.</p>
<p>Topographically, therefore,
passive revolution covers the space of the “war of position” between an expansive hegemony and an open “war
of maneuver” (or “war of movement”) against the popular masses, and it includes not only normal reformist
forms of social control but also goes all the way to the use of “force, fraud, and corruption,” where it borders
with the war of maneuver. Gramsci viewed the 1930s reorganization of capitalism, involving the increased state
intervention in the economy and society that took a variety of political forms, such as the New Deal in USA
and Fascism in Italy, as cases of passive revolution.</p>
<p><strong>‘Sustainable Development’ as Passive Revolution</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable development, as expressed at the international level in the current 2030 Agenda
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN General Assembly Resolution 2015), and in other regional
and national contexts, can be interpreted, mutatis mutandis, as a passive revolution case, in the sense that the
dominant social classes and groups are pursuing their hegemonic visions, state projects and accumulation
strategies by assimilating certain demands from the subaltern and opposing social and political forces and
transforming their radical potential into politically harmless elements.</p>
<p>They succeed in ‘decapitating’
the revolutionary/emancipatory potential of their adversary (the emerging “collective will”) and secure their
own dominance or, even better, hegemony.</p>
<p>The “laws of motion” of capitalism set some very definite limits on the applicability of
policy proposals made by the degrowth school of thought</p>
<p>As Régulation theory (Boyer and Saillard 2002) has shown, there is a variety of accumulation
regimes and modes of regulation that can secure for a certain historical period the reproduction of capitalist social formations.</p>
<p>Nothing precludes the possibility for the dominant powers to adopt some degrowth
measures in a passive revolution manner, by transforming them not only into
harmless elements in their hegemonic visions but also beneficial features
of their immediate economic interests in new concrete state projects.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem with Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>And it all pretty much comes down to Brundtland’s
foreword to the 1987 Our Common Future report: “These links between poverty, inequality and environmental
degradation formed a major theme in our analysis and recommendations. What is needed now is a new era of
economic growth – growth that is forceful and at the same time socially and environmentally sustainable”
(WCED 1987).
Well, as the degrowth, postgrowth or ‘steady-state economy’ schools of thought would argue, this is the
problem with sustainable development; the primacy of economic growth considerations and the
positivist/modernist belief that in the three-circle intersection of economic growth, with environmental
protection and social justice, “win-win” policies can be implemented.</p>
<p>Sustainable development has been called
an “oxymoron,” an attempt to square the circle, to have one’s cake and eat it too, for “how can we protect nature
while keeping on competing and growing economically?”</p>
<p>The dominance
of growth-oriented policies and their contradictory position to sustainability priorities, and also comment on
the vagueness and ambiguity of the term.</p>
<p>The concept is heavily
contested by different and opposing “stakeholders,” who try to appropriate it and give it a meaning according
to their own interests. Some talk about the “highjacking” of sustainability</p>
<p>As the UN documents on sustainable development
fail to identify the historical and structural roots of environmental and social degradation, the proposed solutions
cannot be transformative enough.</p>
<p>Of particular importance to the passive revolution aspects that are discussed herewith, is the framing of
the mainstream sustainable development discourse in a way that can be described as a “post-political”
depoliticization of a political issue <em>par excellence</em>.</p>
<p>The environmental movement may be “the most comprehensive and influential
movement of our time” representing for the ‘post-industrial’ age what the workers’
movement was for the industrial period.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although it is to a large extent recognized that economic growth does not by itself eliminate
poverty nor does it improve the environment, the question remains why then is economic growth – at least in
the Global North – still a goal of sustainable development?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, to stop prioritizing growth and to start
focusing seriously on reducing inequalities on the economic and ecological front, within and among countries,
through redistributive policies, while downscaling the biophysical size of the economy, could have dire
consequences to the process of capital accumulation and the capitalist economy as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So, an alternative,
passive revolution path, along the lines of a green social-democratic discourse of difference, is to reverse the
question and ask if the implementation of social and environmental policies that aim to eliminate poverty and
inequalities, protect the environment and tackle climate change, could in return lead to economic growth, albeit
this time more inclusive and sustainable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initial radicalism of the
environmentalist movement of the 1970s has vanished and as the UN documents on sustainable development
fail to identify the historical and structural roots of environmental and social degradation, the proposed solutions
cannot be transformative enough.</p>
<p>The discourse and project of sustainable development gradually lost its way, it is now
refolded into the much more market-oriented green growth discourse and project, that deviates considerably
from the original sustainability concerns, as it asserts that environmental sustainability is not only compatible
but also depends on the market system.</p>
<p>The question of decoupling economic growth measured in GDP, from growth in environmental impacts
strikes at the heart of the matter and constitutes the ultimate testing field for the theoretical assumptions and
empirical evidence of those who promote the growth solution to all problems. If decoupling via scientific and
technological advancements and “natural capital” substitution by “human-made capital” were feasible, then
growth would be a legitimate sustainability goal. If not, other ways for decoupling should urgently be found if
climate change and pressing environmental (and societal) problems are to be taken seriously.
Based on the second law of thermodynamics but also the findings of authoritative scientific studies on
historical trends and model-based projections for the future, the answer to the decoupling question appears to
be negative.</p>
<p><strong>Radical Degrowth</strong></p>
<p>The sustainable development discourse may have many aspects that contribute to environmental and
social welfare but it is basically a top-down reform project that aims at correcting the environmental and social
externalities to economic growth. It is run by governments that abide by the logic of capital 12 and although in
principle it promotes civic and stakeholder engagement, public participation is limited and is done in a way that
does not seriously challenge the dominant economic paradigm.</p>
<p>The emerging (yet still marginal) alternative, multi-disciplinary, degrowth
academic paradigm
has evolved, in a consistent and quite influential way since the first decade
of this century, from an activist movement and it retains close contacts and open communication with social
movements that support a degrowth transition in economy and society.
An explicit goal of degrowth is the
repoliticization of environmentalism and ending of the depoliticizing consensus on sustainable development.</p>
<p>Degrowth challenges the very foundations of “actually existing” capitalism and erstwhile
socialism alike, as it postulates that infinite economic growth in a finite planet is just impossible and must be
undesirable.</p>
<p>Capitalism is not sustainable in the long run without the dynamics of capital accumulation and
economic growth (periods of economic crisis, which are accompanied by crises in political and ideological
fields, are a proof of that), then degrowth has a strong anti-capitalist/anti-consumerist orientation.</p>
<p>Degrowth has been defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a voluntary, democratically negotiated, equitable downscaling of
economic production and consumption to assure that society’s throughput – resource use and waste – stays within safe ecosystem boundaries</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Futility Limit</strong></p>
<p>As Daly (2007: 17) argues, the rich
countries of the planet have reached a stage of “non-economic growth” (increases in production come at the
cost of resource depletion and well-being that is worth more than the commodities made) and the population is
facing a “futility limit.”</p>
<p>Any utility (level of satisfaction of the populations’ needs and wants) earned
from increased production and consumption is surpassed by the disutility of the level of sacrifice that has to be
endured (workload, loss of leisure, resource depletion, exposure to pollution, congestion)</p>
<p>Daly’s argument is that as we move from the
traditional “empty world” to today’s “full world” economy, we must adjust the economics accordingly.</p>
<p>We can no longer afford to treat the environmental issues as “externalities.”
We must start economizing on and invest in the limiting factor (natural
capital).</p>
<p>Adhere to the tenets of Buddhist economics and the “small is beautiful” slogan
or the low-impact “spaceship economy” in contradistinction
to the voracious “cowboy economy”</p>
<p>Supportive of alternative constructions of economy and society, such
as producer-consumer cooperatives, eco-communities, local currencies and social philosophies of Buen Vivir
and Ubuntu, and promote concrete welfare reform policies such as work-sharing and the reduction of working
hours, job guarantee schemes, introduction of income guarantee, basic and maximum income/wealth, and a shifting from a corporate to a cooperative economy.</p>
<p>If escaping the issue of just redistribution via the growth imaginary is no longer possible,
then a more genuine political settlement of social questions becomes imminent.</p>
<p>Quantitative growth is an inherent characteristic of the capitalist reproduction process
and, since growth, by default, puts enormous pressure on nature, capitalism is not at the end of the day ecologically sustainable.</p>
<p>Proponents of SSE, such as Daly and Lawn , believe that a steady-
state economy is compatible with capitalism (a system based on private property and markets), albeit regulated
by a strongly interventionist social-democratic state. After all, as Lawn (2011) rightly points out, the real deal
in capitalism is to make a profit, not to grow the company.
If you don’t make a profit you die and even though
profit is made by increasing output and sales (the first option), the profitability can also be accomplished by
producing better quality products and selling the same quantity of output at a higher price (a second option) or
by producing the same quantity more efficiently (the third option). It is thus possible to have a steady-state
capitalist economy, with profits but not necessarily with an increased throughput (growth).</p>
<p>Blauwhof (2012) discusses these issues thoroughly. He notes that although Lawn’s first option obviously
leads to growth in both throughput and GDP, the third option does not. In fact, it can lead to a decreased demand,
unsold products and a lower GDP. However, this option has limits, as wages, working hours per product and
other input costs cannot be squeezed forever and also, at some point, the competition will catch up with the
efficiency improvements. Regarding the second option, this could lead to GDP growth but not throughput
growth, as increased revenues can be earned by using the same amount of inputs. Nevertheless, the relation of
higher prices with constant wages (with which the goods will be bought) can lead to a series of problems
associated with a lack of demand. In other words, although in principle the profit motive is not identical to the
growth imperative, a zero-growth economy does not make much sense to the profit-maximizing players of a
competitive economy.</p>
<p>By using Marxian economic analysis of capital accumulation (Blauwhof 2012), 15 including aspects of
Marxist theory such as the tendency of the rate of profit to fall over time (Li 2007), it becomes evident that a
zero-growth society cannot be compatible with an economic system based on the pursuit of profit and
accumulation. Even more important is to look at the geography of the spatial expansion of capital to overcome
the limits of capital accumulation, as “capitalism could not survive without being geographically expansionary
and perpetually seeking out ‘spatial fixes’ for its problems.”</p>
<p>For Marxist eco-socialists, a
fundamental contradiction exists between capital accumulation and planetary boundaries. Capital as a process
(or social relation) of self-expanding value, bound by the laws of capitalist competition, runs the risk of
annihilating itself, and the whole planet.
Accordingly, the SSE institutional and policy
reforms proposed by Daly (2013) and other ecological economists and degrowthers (Kallis 2011, 2015; Kallis
et al. 2012), are well-intentioned and ethical but not really compatible with the workings of a capitalist economy.</p>
<p>From a system based on private property of the means of production and the
commodification of all aspects of social life and nature, to one based on a collective ownership by freely associated individuals and a restoration of the commons.</p>
<pre><code>1. Put life at the center of our economic systems,  
2. Radically re-evaluate how much and what work is necessary for a good life for all,  
3. Organize society around the provision of essential goods and services,
4. Democratize society, and  
5. Base political and economic systems on the principle of solidarity.   </code></pre>
<p>These principles, as further specified in the letter and the degrowth literature in general, certainly aim at a more
egalitarian and sustainable society and they do pose obstacles to the normal circuits of capital accumulation.
But as long as their critical approach to the general concept of “growth society” is not combined with a class
analysis and critique of capitalism (Foster 2011), degrowth’s arguments can be picked up in an ad hoc manner
and transformed by “bourgeois forces” so that they don’t become detrimental to the basic mode of operation of
capitalist social formations.</p>
<p>Degrowth is obliged to offer viable solutions to the job losses and declining living standards of working
people and the poor (Pollin 2018: 22). This can be done only when it takes seriously the class and class-relevant
dimension of the economic and ecological crisis,</p>
<p>The degrowth school tends to avoid the central social question of capitalism and prefers to
draw attention to alternative paths of economic and social organization, such as the social and solidarity
economy, and sustainable community movement organizations.
It places emphasis
on creative, bottom-up initiatives and horizontal networks of collectivities that are blossoming rhizomatically.
It supports a co-evolution of social, cultural and ecological systems.</p>
<p>These are all welcome features of another way of doing things <em>now</em>
but they are not enough, since any good
examples of an alternative economy work only on the fringes of the dominant capitalist mode of production.</p>
<p>In societies based on class antagonisms and unequal distribution of power, any scientific evidence and
logically valid arguments offered by the degrowth movement and its supporters, are a necessary but not
sufficient condition for social change.</p>
<p>A collective identity that is willing to initiate change is needed. This is
constructed through the mechanisms of hegemony, that is by
articulating a plurality of seemingly autonomous and unconnected interests and demands into a coherent
hegemonic vision that is collectively forged through discourse and aims at spreading its influence into society
and “capturing”/altering the state, in order to bring forth social change.</p>
<p>More radical policy proposals that aim at drastic income and wealth
redistribution reforms, in parallel with the promotion of producer cooperatives, as an alternative democratic
form of organization of the economy, would require the formation of a well-built alliance between
environmental and working-class movements.</p>
<p>A Gramscian theory of the state suits degrowth’s work on the combination of grassroots and institutional actions.</p>
<p>Other theorists don’t agree that real change can ever occur through the state, but at the same time
acknowledge that changing the world without taking power is very difficult.</p>
<p>Intervene and try to
introduce as many degrowth aspects as possible into official policy contexts.</p>
<p>An immense task indeed.</p>
