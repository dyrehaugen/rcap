<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> On Piketty</h2>
<p><em>Grewal Memo</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The response to the crisis in Europe has suggested that Brussels now operates as an arm of finance capital and that monetary union is more likely to prove the undertaker of European social democracy than its savior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Piketty’s most recent volume, published in French in 2013, and in English in 2014 as Capital in the Twenty-First Century — a knowing nod to Karl Marx — is a sprawling, ambitious text that builds on this earlier work while rendering it accessible to a wider audience. Its argument, backed by impressive empirical data, may be summed up in three words: capitalism generates inequality.</p>
<p>Capital in the Twenty-First Century has thus prompted discussion of inequality, financial regulation, and political economy across an unusually wide spectrum, and for this alone the work deserves the praise it has received.</p>
<p>Piketty’s major claim — that capitalist societies exhibit a persistent trend of increasing inequality — should come as a prompt to examine the underlying legal and institutional foundations of capitalist economic relations.</p>
<p>Capital in the Twenty-First Century is a study of modern inequality —
of differences in income and wealth among people of equal juridical
status.</p>
<p><em>Reassessment of Kuznets - no ‘self-correcting market’</em></p>
<p>Kuznets won a Nobel Prize in 1971 for his study of U.S. economic growth
and national income between 1913 and 1948. His study arguably
revealed a trend in capitalism toward initially increasing but later
decreasing inequality — the inverted U-shaped relationship now
dubbed the “Kuznets Curve” (pp. 13–15). Piketty sees his own re-
search as broadening “the spatial and temporal limits of Kuznets’s in-
novative and pioneering work” (p. 16). 19 Bringing in more countries
and a longer time horizon — strictly speaking three centuries, though
adequate data are generally available only for the twentieth — leads
Piketty to revise Kuznets’s argument.
Kuznets was charting a historical anomaly.</p>
<p>The attraction of the “Kuznets Curve” is its suggestion, at
least in its popularized version, that further economic growth will au-
tomatically correct the problems that growth itself brings — and with-
out having to elaborate the causal mechanisms that bring about such
self-correction.</p>
<p>Kuznets was appropriately circumspect about the limits
of his model and the generality of his conclusions.
Others have subsequently argued, however, that the same inverted U-shaped relation-
ship suggesting a “self-correcting market mechanism” obtains in many
other areas: environmental degradation, health outcomes, and edu-
cational opportunities.</p>
<p>Piketty’s comprehensive reassessment of Kuznets’s data has unset-
tled the confidence that the market will “self-correct” in terms of ine-
quality and highlighted instead the exceptional nature of the postwar
period.</p>
<p>Piketty’s empirical analyses confirm in the register of the statistical a
reality we already intuit.</p>
<p>This
empirical ratification flatly contradicts earlier narratives concerning
the relationship between capitalism, equality, and democracy that have
long been taken for granted by the many people of North America and
Europe who got ahead in the postwar period but whose children and
grandchildren look increasingly unlikely to be able to do the same</p>
<p>A few hundred individuals now possess fortunes so vast that their wealth
represents not so much private luxury as public power. They can buy
media corporations 30 and private military contractors; they can sway
individual elections and determine electoral trends. When they de-
cide to engage in philanthropy, they can direct expenditures on a scale
that rivals the capacity of almost any national government or interna-
tional organization, and thus reorient humanitarian, cultural, and sci-
entific agendas to their personal priorities. They can coopt state
functions to preserve or extend their wealth through privatizations,
special bailouts, and preferential treatment of various kinds, which so-
cializes risk while privatizing profit.</p>
<p>Why, then, has r &gt; g held generally?
Piketty has painstakingly established that it has, and he has some
suggestions as to how it undergirds the more visible inequalities
of income and wealth.
As for its ultimate causes, however, we must treat Piketty’s
book as a catalyst for further research on the legal, social, political,
and economic dimensions of inequality under capitalism.</p>
<p>What the critics of the neoclassical position were suggesting was
not simply that it is incoherent
to attempt to value capital without positing an exogenous rate of return,
but also that “capital” does not really exist in any determinate
fashion.
<em>Rather, what exists is legally structured access to the variety
of resources that people use to produce things, and the market value of
this access cannot be determined without examining its distribution —
which is necessarily given by politics and social conditions rather than
by a purely technical process.</em></p>
<p>While critics have argued that Piketty
missed this point, owing to his use of standard neoclassical formula-
tions, 67 it may nevertheless be possible to interpret his conclusions
sympathetically. What he has estimated is not a physical stock of stuff
so much as the market valuation of the extent of capitalist privilege,
ramified across a range of assets from houses to machines to software
programs, which he recognizes has varied across historical periods as a
result of changing economic policy.</p>
<p>Perhaps his analysis
can thus be said to be Sraffian in spite of itself: we may note the inco-
herence of trying to assume an aggregate rate of return on capital even
while recognizing that the deepest import of Piketty’s work will be to
bring renewed attention to the view that distribution is a social and
political issue.</p>
<p><strong>CAPITALISM AS A LEGAL ORDERING</strong></p>
<p>Understanding why r &gt; g has generally held — and why it briefly did
not — requires an account of capitalism as a socioeconomic system struc-
tured through law. Capitalism is fundamentally a legal ordering: the
bargains at the heart of capitalism are products of law.</p>
<p>While these legal
foundations go mostly unexamined in Capital in the Twenty-First Cen-
tury, the book should prompt further study of the actual laws of capi-
talism — those behind the statistical regularities discussed as “laws” —
that is, of the various legal and institutional arrangements governing
capitalist economic systems.</p>
<p>Before the term “capitalism” became widespread in the late nineteenth
century, the regime in which most people secure material needs
through market exchange was simply called “commercial society.” The
legal underpinnings of commercial society were of central concern to
its early observers — students of classical political economy. From
Smith’s Lectures on Jurisprudence in the early 1760s through the
French économistes’ analyses of agrarian production and property
law to Marx’s study of labor regulations, the ambition was not to
study markets in the abstract, but to uncover the legal foundations of
commercial society. In this pursuit, these economists were not merely
observers but advocates of reform of one kind or another. To use a
limited (and anachronistic) vocabulary, their concerns were inextricably
“normative” and “positive” — in part for the general reason that
there is never a clean analytic separation between these orientations,
but also because the “economy,” which was the object of their study,
was in the process of active construction.</p>
<p>In that construction, the two markets of overwhelming concern to
the early theorist-advocates were those in grain and labor. Reforming
them required eliminating price controls and supply requirements on
grain — which constituted what has been called the “moral economy”
in food, whereby the state or local community accepted ultimate re-
sponsibility for its provision — and abolishing guild restrictions on
entry into trades, as well as feudal dues and related obligations in the
countryside. It was believed that the labor and grain markets were
linked, such that a reorientation in one required, and pushed along re-
ciprocally, a corresponding reorientation in the other. The result of
this deregulated 75 grain-labor market would be, according to its advo-
cates, progress for the poor, productivity in agriculture, the enhance-
ment of the power and wealth of the state (owing to a larger tax base),
and the dissolution of vestigial feudal relations through the commer-
cialization of labor relations and the free rental or sale of farmland.</p>
<p><em>The focus of free market advocacy</em></p>
<p>At the heart of this argument was the claim that higher grain prices
would lead to more abundant food and higher wages, ultimately help-
ing the poor. Defenders of the moral economy resisted this conclusion,
either on the ground that this claim, like many others in the discourse
of political economy, was paradoxical, or else by arguing that higher
grain prices might indeed stimulate agricultural production but that
the increased long-run provision of food would do nothing to alleviate
the short-term dearth that was the target of government regulation.
Reforming
markets in grain and labor required reconceptualizing property and
contract law, in addition to developing new state regulations and
public infrastructures.</p>
<p>The consequence of these policies was the creation of the
modern industrial economy, in which urban workers sell their labor in
competitive markets for wages and then use this money to purchase
foodstuffs produced by a much smaller number of farmers. The grad-
ual generalization of such wage work in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries made European states (and subsequently their colonies) into
“capitalist” societies, in which markets and the division of labor are
central to the distribution of essential goods and services, in contrast to
earlier societies in which markets played a less central role in the pro-
duction and distribution of basic resources.</p>
<p>This “freeing” of the grain and labor markets was not a simple hy-
draulic process (though it was often depicted as such) in which the
dead weight of state regulation was removed, allowing a wellspring of
commercial sociability to bubble up. Rather, this new market regime
was understood from its inception to be a positive legal construction.
It required the creation of a new legal order, the drafting of the laws of
capitalism. At the foundation of these laws was a new conception of
juridical equality based on freedom of contract and private property in
which no formal distinctions among parties would be recognized.</p>
<p>Corresponding to this equality before law was the delegation of pro-
ductive activity to private agents linked through markets — that is, to
agents understood to be acting in their “private” capacity.</p>
<p>The regime was given public legitimation through new constitutional orders
that ratified formal equality among persons and gave special protec-
tions to the rights of contract and property.</p>
<p><em>Constitution of Capitalism</em></p>
<p>In France and the United States — and then elsewhere — these
new constitutional orders solved the puzzle of creating a political
whole out of the legally equal, discrete individuals of commercial soci-
ety by establishing revolutionary frameworks predicated on the dis-
tinction between “sovereignty” and “government.” In practice, this
ordering provides for the periodic reaffirmation of the sovereignty of
the people in the form of direct ratification of fundamental legislation,
either at the moment of constitutional inauguration or through ongoing
processes of constitutional amendment, but through a variety of
countermajoritarian mechanisms, it places limits on the ability of the
people to radically revise the legal rules underlying commercial socie-
ty. The result is what we might call the “constitution of capitalism,”
understood in a double sense as the constitutional order that most cap-
italist societies have adopted historically and the legal foundation of
the social processes that constitute the economic system of capitalism.</p>
<p><em>Streeck</em></p>
<p>A detailed study of these legal foundations is essential to understanding
the institutional structure of capitalism. Here the insights of
institutional political economy and law and economics may be usefully
adapted to the task. As Professor Wolfgang Streeck has recently argued,
the institutionalist turn in social science has produced general insights
that can, with a few “parametric specifications,” be put to use
in the study of capitalism as a “specific type of social order,” under-
girded by distinct legal arrangements. Supplementing Marx’s insights
about the organization of wage-labor, Streeck suggests a variety
of other empirical features characterizing capitalism. These include
the presumed legitimacy of pursuing gain through private contract
without, for the most part, being constrained by traditionalist
“supernorms,” expectations of social solidarity, restraints on competition, or
elite duties to ensure “system survival”; the expectation that rule
followers are “rational-egoistic” in their orientation rather than norm
internalizers with respect to the purpose of a rule (as with, for exam-
ple, financial regulations); and a “differential endowment of classes
with resources,” which results in classes having different capacities
for effective agency, including disparate ability to mobilize political
coalitions to advance their interests.</p>
<p>The mid-twentieth-century reversal of
r &gt; g emerged from deep changes in the regulation of the market.</p>
<p>Understanding the movement from patrimonial capitalism to the
postwar “mixed economy” and back requires a nuanced account of
what John Commons long ago called the “legal foundations of capital-
ism,” and which legal realists from Robert Hale to Karl Llewellyn to
Jerome Frank put at the center of their analyses. The return to
Hale-style legal realism in the analysis of public institutions and “pri-
vate” law may help stimulate a “law and economics” approach to the
study of capitalism, rather than an approach in which markets are
considered abstractly.
Subjects that would be particularly im-
portant to study include the causes and consequences of the post-
feudal reconstitution of property law, and the ways in which labor,
public benefits, and corporate law together structure the modern labor
market as an arena of “contested exchange” in which “economic pow-
er” is structured through various contractual mechanisms. These
and related inquiries would help us understand the conditions under
which formal equality of contract is compatible with widening eco-
nomic inequality. We must also consider the way that law structures
not just the particular bargains in capitalism (most prominently, the
wage bargain), but also the broader social and political setting of the
market. Here the dynamics of public and private debt, the regula-
tion of finance in an age of “financialization,” the constraints placed
on democratic control of the economy by international integration,
and the problem of “commodification” understood as the regulation of
“contested commodities” and “blocked exchanges” may prove espe-
cially salient.</p>
<p>In studying these issues, Piketty’s work should lead us to consider
how the legal foundations of capitalism influence the rate of return on
capital and its consistent outpacing of overall growth.</p>
<p>The ways different areas of the law interact to affect the inequality r &gt; g may be
considerably complex.</p>
<p>While Piketty’s numbers invite a welcome debate on inequality, they do not,
of course, tell us how to regard that inequality, let alone how to
remedy it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Piketty’s empirical assessments need
to be situated within a broader structural account of the dynamics of
capitalism, as I suggest above in describing capitalism as a legal order-
ing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Andrew Glyn and Wolfgang Streeck</em></p>
<p>Combining Glyn and Streeck with Piketty helps us to identify
where the fault lines of future political contests will lie: in broad fights
over debt, taxation, and public spending as the fiftieth through nineti-
eth percentiles in the income and wealth tables lose ground to the top
10%, and in more specific conflicts as professionals and small busi-
nesspeople in the top 10% lose ground to the 1% and yet smaller frac-
tions. They also suggest that these problems ultimately emerge from
differential power — the ability of some groups rather than others to
control the state.</p>
<p>Piketty’s proposal for a global wealth tax assumes a co-
ordinated, top-down, data-driven, and retrospective response to the in-
equalities that capitalism generates — and in this he globalizes the fa-
miliar presumption of many economists that taxation ex post is a
better way to address inequality than ex ante changes to the legal rules
governing the economy.</p>
<p>Piketty’s proposal for a global wealth tax assumes a co-
ordinated, top-down, data-driven, and retrospective response to the in-
equalities that capitalism generates — and in this he globalizes the fa-
miliar presumption of many economists that taxation ex post is a
better way to address inequality than ex ante changes to the legal rules
governing the economy.</p>
<p>On that view, it is more efficient to allow
the unencumbered market to generate wealth — which can later be
redistributed — than to attempt to alter the organization of the market
in the first place. But the question as to whether ex ante or ex post
mechanisms are more efficient assumes that both are politically feasi-
ble — and it may be naïve to assume that after letting the inequality-
producing market run its course there will be any agent left at the end
of the process capable of demanding redistribution.</p>
<p>Indeed, on a more
path-dependent conception of political action, it may be only through
structural changes to the economy — which galvanize political coali-
tions while resurrecting distributive questions — that an electorate be-
comes capable of demanding higher tax rates. It was mass political
empowerment at the height of the labor movement, drawing on post-
war solidarity, that achieved the high marginal tax rates of the mid-
century as part of a broader redesign of the terms of economic cooper-
ation. If Piketty’s proposal for a global capital tax is, in his own
words, “utopian” (p. 515), it is because it presumes a political agent ca-
pable of enacting it, which is neither present now nor likely to be gen-
erated by the trends he identifies.</p>
<p>If
contemporary capitalism increasingly resembles the period before the
exceptional times began, we should perhaps draw on the correspond-
ing array of political strategies: general strikes and labor activism, ex-
periments with new forms of cooperative industrial organization, and
radical political and social movements.</p>
<p>What has occurred since
the 1970s, to varying degrees, is a shift of approximately 5% of nation-
al wealth from the fiftieth through ninetieth percentiles up into the top
decile, much of it into the top percentile.</p>
<p>The failure of the financial crisis of 2008 to produce any lasting
movement for fundamental economic reform may seem to confirm
Professor Perry Anderson’s pessimistic assessment over a decade ago
that “[t]he only starting-point for a realistic Left today is a lucid regis-
tration of historical defeat.</p>
<p>To this pessimism of the intellect, however, we
should muster an optimism of the will. More than Lenin or Bernstein,
Capital in the Twenty-First Century brings Antonio Gramsci to mind.
Whatever the limits of his particular proposals, Piketty has fired a
forceful shot in what Gramsci described as the “war of position,” the
slow but vital work of consciousness-raising that must precede the
“war of manoeuvre,” 144 or “movement,” 145 during which distributional
claims are asserted directly in political contests.</p>
<p>The history of capitalism in the twenty-first century remains to
be written — and politics, rather than the natural operation of the
market, will finish the story.</p>
<p>As Piketty concludes: “If democracy is
someday to regain control of capitalism, it must start by recognizing
that the concrete institutions in which democracy and capitalism are
embodied need to be reinvented again and again”</p>
