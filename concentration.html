<p><em>Geir Ivar Jørgensen, Gule Vester Norge:</em>
Vi er eid av den korporative statens eiere
Korporativisme av fascistisk kulør er hva vi har med å gjøre
Korporasjoner styrer alle samfunnsområder for å tjene et globalisert oligarki av eiere.
Beviset bør alle snart ha oppfattet ved hvor mye 1 prosenten eier i forhold til alle andre.
Velgerne kan endre på dette, men da må de stemme de korporative eieres politiske lakeier bort fra makten.
I Norge betyr det at velgerne må slutte å stemme på Ap+Erna &amp; Co. fordi det er deres ansvar at vi blir overstyrt av EU via EØS-avtalen. EU er et politisk system som har korporativisme som fundament og struktur. EU er skapt av og for den korporative statens aktører.</p>

<p><em>Memo Superstars</em></p>
<p>As a proportion of GDP, American corporate profits are higher
than they have been at any time since 1929.</p>
<p>Pulling ahead of their rivals in one area after another and building up powerful defences against competition, including enormous cash piles equivalent to 10% of GDP in America and as much as 47% in Japan.</p>
<p>In the 1980s and 1990s management gurus pointed to the “demise of size” as big companies seemed to be giving way to a much more entrepreneurial economy.
Giants such as AT&amp;T were broken up and state-owned firms were privatised. High-tech companies emerged from nowhere. Peter Drucker, a veteran management thinker, announced that “the Fortune 500 [list of the biggest American companies] is over.” That chimed with the ideas of Ronald Coase, an academic who had argued in “The Nature of the Firm” (1937) that companies make sense only when they can provide the services concerned more cheaply than the market can.</p>
<p>But now size seems to matter again. The McKinsey Global Institute, the consultancy’s research arm, calculates that 10% of the world’s public companies generate 80% of all profits.
Firms with more than $1 billion in annual revenue account for nearly 60% of total global revenues and 65% of market capitalisation.</p>
<p>The share of nominal GDP generated by the Fortune 100 biggest American companies rose from about 33% of GDP in 1994 to 46% in 2013, and the Fortune 100’s share of the revenues generated by the Fortune 500 went up from 57% to 63% over the same period. The number of listed companies in America nearly halved between 1997 and 2013, from 6,797 to 3,485, according to Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and two colleagues, reflecting the trend towards consolidation and growing size. Sales by the median listed public company are almost three times as big as they were 20 years ago. Profit margins have increased in direct proportion to the concentration of the market.</p>
<p>Startups, meanwhile, have found it harder to get off the ground. Robert Litan, of the Council on Foreign Relations, and Ian Hathaway, of the Brookings Institution, note that the number of startups is lower than at any time since the late 1970s, and that more companies die than are born, pushing up their average age.</p>
<p>The superstar effect is particularly marked in the knowledge economy. In Silicon Valley a handful of giants are enjoying market shares and profit margins not seen since the robber barons in the late 19th century. “Competition is for losers,” says Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, a payments system, and the first outside investor in Facebook. On Wall Street the five largest banks have increased their share of America’s banking assets from 25% in 2000 to 45% today.</p>
<p>Today’s superstar companies are big in different ways from their predecessors. In the old days companies with large revenues and global footprints almost always had lots of assets and employees. Some superstar companies, such as Walmart and Exxon, still do. But digital companies with huge market valuations and market shares typically have few assets.</p>
<p>Yet even “old” big companies employ far fewer people than they used to. Exxon, the world’s most successful oil company, has cut back its workforce from 150,000 in the 1960s to less than half that today, despite having merged with a giant rival, Mobil</p>
<p>The “new” big companies are becoming more like the corporations of yore. High-tech companies often give senior jobs to former Washington insiders and employ armies of lobbyists. Many modern superstar companies park their money in offshore hideaways and devote considerable efforts to keeping down their tax bills. Superstar companies tend to excel at everything they do—including squeezing as much as they can out of government while paying the lowest possible taxes.</p>
<p>The age of entrepreneurialism, ushered in by Britain’s Margaret Thatcher and America’s Ronald Reagan, is giving way to an age of corporate consolidation even as most companies are becoming more virtual</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Land Oligopoly</h2>
<p>“When the billionaires buy up all the farmland,
you can feel the late stages of civilization collapse” (Joe Brewer)</p>
<p>Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world has been quietly
snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. —
enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.
Gates, who has a net worth of nearly $121 billion according to Forbes,
has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states.
His largest holdings are in Louisiana (69,071 acres), Arkansas (47,927 acres)
and Nebraska (20,588 acres).
Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land
on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.</p>
<p>This is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture.
In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced
$306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture
among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
The foundation has further invested in the development and
proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change
and higher-yield dairy cows.</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used,
or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation.
(Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment.)
However, there is some indication that the land could be used
in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values.
Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade,
is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes
sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections
of crops, soil and water resources.</p>
<p>While Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner,
he by no means is the largest individual landowner.
In its list of 100 top American landowners,
The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone,
who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests.
CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land
across eight states.
Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale,
landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres,
mainly in west Texas.</p>
