<p><em>Jason Moore</em></p>
<p>Every civilization must decide what is, and what is not, valuable.
The Marxist tradition makes occasional reference to a “law of
value.”</p>
<p>Historians of
capitalism don’t much care to speak of a law of value, much less put
it to work, some also reject it as
a kind of metaphysics. But there are hopeful signs that
this lacuanue is being addressed. Recently, value thinking has made a
comeback of sorts—some pushing to grasp how value is rooted in
historical capitalism’s production of nature.</p>
<p>Among Marxist Greens, the dominant
approach remains Nature and Capitalism, Nature plus Capitalism. In
this, the “exploitation of nature and labor” are co-productive of capi-
talist development - a move that confuses, even elides,
how capitalism values the specific contributions of both.</p>
<p>Absent synthesis, Marxist Greens chose an arithmetic rather than
dialectical solution. What happened was an intellectual override of
Marx’s value thinking by a historical materialism largely cleansed of
its value relations. Crystallized by the groundbreaking work of John
Bellamy Foster and his colleagues, historical materialism was recon-
figured as ontological dualism: the “metabolism of nature and soci-
ety”. Humans make history, and so does nature.
This solved a big problem. It addressed a major lacuna in Marxist
thought, putting Nature into the frame. The history of capitalism
could now be addressed through an expanded conceptualization: the
history of capitalism equals the exploitation of nature and labor. End-
less accumulation equals the degradation of nature equals catastro-
phe. The law of value is sometimes invoked, but as window dressing,
not part of the window itself</p>
<p>The difficulty emerges in the lack of explanation of how value is
produced, and how the relations of value are reproduced on an ex-
tended scale. Historical materialism cleansed of its value relations al-
lows for a certain ease of description: there is a “metabolic rift” be-
tween human and natural systems; capitalism is a human system;
capitalism does terrible stuff to natural systems. Catastrophe ensues.
The problem with all of this is that it doesn’t really explain how these
historical processes <em>work</em>. This becomes a problem because effective
political strategy and policy responses must have a sense of how cap-
italism has transformed the biosphere, and how the biosphere is
transforming capitalism. This is what a value-relational approach can
offer.</p>
<p>Working from the curious abstraction that humans are separate
from nature—as if the air we breathe, the food we eat, the energy we
use have no meaningful analytics—the Green position cannot answer
its fundamental questions: How do we view nature, in part or as a
whole, as valuable? What are the ethics of a sustainable civilization?
How are the valuations of nature practiced in the modern world
through markets, states, and ideas?</p>
<p>Such questions can only be addressed by inverting the great bi-
ases of Green Thought. Not, “How are humans separate from na-
ture?”, but “How do humans “fit” in the web of life?” Not, “How are
humans destroying nature?”, but “How do humans put nature, hu-
man natures included, to work?” These are the questions that might
allow for a more nearly adequate analysis of how capitalism works
through nature, and how nature works through capitalism. Effective
answers will turn on our capacity to see humans as part of nature, to
see civilizations as producers and products of particular, historical na-
tures, and to see those historical natures at work in the birth and de-
velopment, not just the “collapse” of civilizations. On offer through a
reconstruction of Marx’s value thinking is the possibility of joining
the politico-economic and ethico-political dimensions of “laws of
value” in successive historical systems.</p>
<p><strong>From land to labour productivity</strong></p>
<p>For capitalism, the choice has
been clear, and peculiar. “Value” is determined by labor productivity
in commodity production: the average labor-time embedded in the
average commodity. This kind of value was unprecedented, and its
expressions were spectacular. For feudalism, and tributary civiliza-
tions in general, wealth turned on land productivity.</p>
<p><strong>Cheap Natures</strong></p>
<p>A capitalist looks at a forest and sees dollar signs,
an environmentalist trees and birds and soils, a world-ecologist how
humans and other species have co-produced the forest and how that
“bundled” forest simultaneously conditions and constrains capital to-
day. It is this ethico-political moment of capitalism’s Cheap Nature
strategy that is today in question as never before, as movements for
food sovereignty, climate justice, and de-growth challenge valuations
of wealth and power premised on capital and its dualist ontology.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of ‘Law’</strong></p>
<p>Let us be clear that “law” is a term we get from Marx, who
got it from Hegel. Law, in this sense, is a not an iron law of determi-
nation, but rather a law in the “Hegelian sense of the ‘abstract’”.
To speak of a law of value, then, is not to engage
history in a prisonhouse of structural abstraction, but to advance a
working proposition about a durable pattern of power and produc-
tion that has been obtained over the time and space of historical cap-
italism. To pick up on one of Marx’s favored metaphors, the law of
value acts as a kind of gravitational field, shaping broad patterns, yet
allowing significant contingency.</p>
<p>The law of value as a durable pattern stems from value
relations that unify a contradictory relation between and among hu-
mans and the rest of nature. This concept of value therefore defies
the Cartesian ordering of reality into a Nature/Society binary.</p>
<p>If the substance of value in histor-
ical capitalism is abstract social labor, understood as necessary labor-
time, the relations that make this possible reach beyond the point of
commodity production, and into the reproduction of labor-power
and the appropriation of extra-human natures.
It is in this sense that
we can speak of the law of value as an organizing principle of capitalism
as world-ecology, joining the accumulation of capital, the pursuit
of power, and the co-production of nature as an organic whole</p>
<p><strong>Cartesian Dualism</strong></p>
<p>One of the enduring legacies of Cartesian dualism is a
privileging of substances over relations in thinking about value.</p>
<p><strong>Marxist Law</strong></p>
<p>The Marxist law of value forgets that that Nature—with capital “N”—contributes to the
value of all the products that humans use. To which the Marxist, quite
properly, says that the whole basis of Marx’s political economy is the
distinction between “wealth” and “value.”</p>
<p><strong>THE LAW OF VALUE AS A LAW OF CHEAP NATURE</strong></p>
<p>The way forward looks something like this. The substance of value
is socially necessary labor-time. The drive to advance labor productiv-
ity is fundamental to competitive fitness. This means that the exploi-
tation of commodified labor-power is central to capital accumula-
tion, and to the survival of individual capitalists. But this cannot be
the end of the story. For the relations necessary to accumulate ab-
stract social labor are necessarily more expansive, in scale, scope,
speed, and intensity. Capital must not only ceaselessly accumulate
and revolutionize commodity production; it must ceaselessly search
for, and find ways to produce, Cheap Natures that can deliver a rising
stream of low-cost food, labor-power, energy, and raw materials to the
factory gates. (Or office doors, or . . . .) These are the Four Cheaps.
The law of value in a capitalist society is a law of Cheap Nature.</p>
<p><strong>Accumulation Waves</strong></p>
<p>Every great wave of accumulation turns on Cheap Nature, understood as use-values produced with
a below average value-composition. In systemic terms, Cheap Nature
is produced when the interlocking agencies of capital, science, and
empire—blunt categories, yes—succeed in releasing new sources of
free or low-cost human and extra-human natures for capital.</p>
<p><strong>Cheap Nature as Accumulation Strategy</strong></p>
<p>Cheap Nature is “cheap” in a historically specific sense, defined
by the periodic, and radical, reduction in the socially necessary labor-
time of these Big Four inputs: food, labor-power, energy, and raw ma-
terials. 1 Cheap Nature, as accumulation strategy, works by reducing
the value composition, but increasing the technical composition, of
capital as a whole.</p>
<p>The genius of capitalism’s Cheap Nature strategy was to rep-
resent time as linear, space as flat, and nature as external.</p>
<p><strong>Commodity Frontiers</strong></p>
<p>Commodity frontiers, or frontiers of appropriation, are central.
This leads to the tightly connective movements of
“internal” restructuring and geographical expansion that restore and
reconfigure the Four Cheaps. The great expansions of the long nine-
teenth and twentieth centuries turned on cheap coal and oil, cheap
metals, and cheap food, alongside the massive destabilization of peas-
ant societies from eastern Europe to East Asia.</p>
<p>Capitalism depends on a repertoire of strategies for appropri-
ating the unpaid work/energy of humans and the rest of nature out-
side of the commodity system. These strategies cannot be reduced to
so-called economic relations but are enabled by a mix of science,
power, and culture. Crucially, science, power, and culture operate
within value’s gravitational field, <em>and are co-constitutive of it</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Exploitation and Appropriation</strong></p>
<p>The implication is explosive: the law of value represents a deter-
mination of socially necessary labor-time which occurs simultane-
ously through organizational and technical innovation and through
strategies of appropriating the unpaid work/energy of “women, na-
ture, and colonies”.</p>
<p>Without massive streams of unpaid work/energy from the rest of
nature—including that delivered by women—the costs of production would rise,
and accumulation would slow.</p>
<p>Every act of exploitation (of commodified labor-power)
therefore depends on an even greater act of appropriation (of un-
paid work/energy). Wage-workers are exploited, everyone else, hu-
man and extra-human, is appropriated. As goes the old Marxist joke:
The only thing worse than being exploited is . . . <em>being appropriated</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words: Value doesn’t work unless most work isn’t valued.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Value, then, cannot be regarded as a discrete “economic” process
alongside that of class struggle and class formation any more than
value-relations can be understood as a social process independent of
the web of life. There is no recipe that can deliver us from either
abstract structuralism or abstract voluntarism; the most useful guide
is to tack back and forth between the logic of capital and the history
of capitalism, between the apparently “social” and the seemingly “en-
vironmental.”</p>
<p>The essential problem with both Red
and Green approaches is their acceptance of modernity’s most basic
assumption: Humans are separate from Nature.
Marx’s contribution pointed towards a much different line of thinking:
Humans are “natural forces” ; they are linked to nature
internally; capitalism “robs” us of our “vital forces” in the same
way as it robs the soil of its nutrients; our life-activity
simultaneously changes us, our relations within nature, and the “historical
natures” around us.</p>
<p>The contradictions and contingencies of capital-
ism unfold through developments within and between the zone of
exploitation and the zone of appropriation. In this, exploitation en-
compasses labor-power within the commodity system, while appropriation
encompasses the transfers of uncapitalized work/energy necessary
to accumulation but not actually penetrated by the capital
relation.</p>
<p>Modernity’s law of value is an exceedingly peculiar way of organizing
life in a civilization. Born amidst the rise of capitalism after
1450, the law of value enabled an unprecedented historical transition
from land productivity to labor productivity as the metric of wealth
and power. It was an ingenious civilizational strategy, for it enabled
the deployment of capitalist <em>technics</em>—crystallizations of tools and
ideas, power and nature—to appropriate the wealth of uncommodified
nature (human work included) in service to advancing labor
productivity within the zone of commodification. The great leap for-
ward in the scale, scope, and speed of landscape and biological
transformations in the three centuries after 1450 may be understood in
this light.</p>
<p>Marx’s value theory identifies a “deep structure” of historical capitalism.
Understanding capitalism as premised on a fundamental
disequilibrium in the value relation of capitalization and appropriation
in the web of life.</p>
<p><strong>Limits to Capitalism</strong></p>
<p>It would be mystifying to say
that the limits of capitalism are ultimately determined by the bio-
sphere itself, although in an abstract sense this is true. But this is a
view of Nature as an independent system. This is insufficient to un-
derstand how capitalism reaches limits, <em>how</em> capitalism has transcended
limits historically, and <em>how</em> capitalism has remade successive
historical natures in a way that may pose intractable problems for its
survival today.</p>
<p>Marx’s conception of value seems to offer a useful way to answer
these questions. It allows us to discern not merely the patterns of
power, re/production, and accumulation over the longue durée, but
the logic animating these patterns’ emergence and evolution
- locating value as a gravitational field.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong></p>
<p>Money is very important, and of course central to capitalist civilization. What money
represents, however, is not nearly as obvious. Money is so important in
historical capitalism because it is central to three interconnected pro-
cesses: 1) carving out a part of human activity, paid work, and giving
it special value, 2) de-valuing the rest of nature, so as to put these
natures to work for free, or low cost, 3) governing the evolving
boundary between capitalization and appropriation, between “economy,”
its constitutive relations, and the web of life.</p>
<p>Marx’s essential insight on
the role of money-capital in <em>negotiating blockages</em> within the circuit
of capital applies equally to those operating within the circuits of
Cheap Nature.</p>
<p><strong>Value Thinking</strong></p>
<p>Recognizing capital accumulation as both objective process and
subjective project, Marx’s value thinking offers a promising way to
comprehend the inner connections between accumulation, biophysical
change, and modernity as a whole.</p>
<p>These inner connections
could be glimpsed from the origins of modernity. They underpin the
epoch-making transformations of land and labor in early modern
capitalism (Moore 2017). These transformations were not however,
the straightforward result of capital in its economic expression. This
strange metric, value, oriented the whole of West-Central Europe
towards an equally strange conquest of space. The geographical
movements of commodification and appropriation were mutually
determined by a symbolic-material reworking of space through value.</p>
<p><strong>Frontier-making</strong></p>
<p>While all civilizations had frontiers of a sort, capitalism did
something very different. Before the sixteenth century, a civilization’s
frontiers—such as feudal Europe’s drive east of the Elbe—were more-
or-less an output of the system. With the rise of capitalism, frontier-
making was much more fundamental: not merely a safety value, but
a constitutive spatial moment of unlocking the epoch-making potential
of endless accumulation. The extension of capitalist power to
new, uncommodified spaces became the lifeblood of capitalism.</p>
<p>The appropriation of unpaid work signifies something beyond
the important—but still too partial—notion of environmental costs
and externalities as “missing” from the determination of value.
For capitalism is not merely a system of unpaid costs
(“externalities”), but of unpaid work (“invisibilities”).</p>
<p>The “free gifts” of nature are
not “low-hanging fruit” that can simply be picked without much time
or effort. Cheap Natures are actively produced by human activity bun-
dled with the rest of nature; human and extra-human natures both are
replete with creativity and contingency. All life is actively, creatively,
incessantly engaged in environment-making, such that, in the mod-
ern world, human ingenuity (such as it is) and human activity (such
as it has been) must activate the work of particular natures in order
to appropriate particular streams of unpaid work. Such activation is
a co-produced reality, bundling the life-activities of human and extra-
human nature in the present, and accumulated over time.</p>
<p>The substance of value is
abstract social labor, or socially necessary labor-time, implicated in
the production of surplus value. On the other hand, this production
of value is particular—it does not value everything, only labor-power
in the circuit of capital—and therefore rests upon a series of devalu-
ations. Plenty of work, the majority of work in the orbit of capitalism,
does not register as valuable.</p>
<p>For good reason,
Hribal (2003) asks, “Are animals part of the working class?” The ques-
tion itself illuminates the law of value’s absurd, yet consistent, praxis.
Although confusion persists on the matter, it is now clear that Marx
understood that extra-human natures perform all sorts of useful (but
not specifically Valuable) work for capitalist production, and that such
useful work was imminent to the capital-relation.</p>
<p>All of these de-valued and un-valued forms of work are, however,
outside the value form (the commodity). They do not directly pro-
duce value. And yet—and this is a very big and yet—value as abstract
labor cannot be produced except through unpaid work/energy. This
leads me to an unavoidable conclusion: the value <em>form</em> and the value
<em>relation</em> are non-identical.</p>
<p>The “commodification of everything” can
only be sustained through the incessant revolutionizing, yes, of the
forces of production, but also the relations of reproduction.</p>
<p>The historical condition for socially necessary labor-time is
socially necessary unpaid work. De-valued work is an “immanent . . .
antithesis” within the generalization of commodity production and
exchange.</p>
<p>In this contradiction, between the ex-
panded reproduction of capital and the reproduction of life, we have
“two universes, two ways of life foreign to each other yet whose wholes
explain one another”.
The geographical implica-
tion of this enabling and constraining tension between paid and un-
paid work? The necessity of frontier-making.</p>
<p>Commodity frontiers were so epoch-making
because they extended the zone of appropriation faster than the zone
of commodification.</p>
<p>The endless frontier strategy of historical capitalism is
premised on a vision of the world as endless.</p>
<p><em>VALUE: SYSTEMIC OR “ECONOMIC” RELATION?</em></p>
<p>It will consequently not suffice to identify the influence of ab-
stract social labor as an “economic” phenomenon, although this re-
mains pivotal. The endless frontier strategy of historical capitalism is
premised on a vision of the world as endless: this is the conceit of
capital and its theology of endless substitutability.
At best, substitut-
ability occurs within definite limits, primarily those of energy flows
and the geographical flexibility they offer. The history of capitalism is
one of relentless flexibility rather than endless substitutability.</p>
<p>The
conditions through which successive world-ecological revolutions have
been realized—each yielding a quantum leap in the mass of “physical
bodies” and making new streams of unpaid work/energy available for
commodity production—may be understood as a succession of one-off
affairs. Capitalism has moved from peat and charcoal to coal to oil,
from the breadbaskets of the Vistula, southern England, the American
Midwest, from labor frontiers in Europe and Africa, Latin America,
and South and East Asia. These are not repeatable events. Substituta-
bility does not unfold through infinite time and space.</p>
<p>Abstract social labor, in this reading, is the economic expression of
the law of value. That law is unworkable historically without strategies
of appropriating cheap nature. Why? Because the creation of socially
necessary labor-time is constituted through a shifting balance of
human and extra-human work; the co-production of nature, in other words,
is constitutive of socially necessary labor-time.</p>
<p>If climate change suppresses agricultural productivity—as it is has been doing for some
time now—the value-composition of agricultural production shifts
accordingly. Socially necessary labor-time forms and re-forms in and
through the web of life.</p>
<p>Early capitalism’s landscape transforma-
tions, in their epoch-making totality, were unthinkable without new
ways of mapping space, controlling time, and cataloguing external
nature—and they are inexplicable solely in terms of world-market or
class-structural change. The law of value, far from reducible to
abstract social labor, finds its necessary conditions of self-expansion
through the creation and subsequent appropriation of cheap human
and extra-human natures. These movements of appropriation must,
if capital is to forestall the rising costs of production, be secured
through extra-economic procedures and processes.</p>
<p>By this I mean something more than the recurrent waves of prim-
itive accumulation that we have come to accept as a cyclical phenom-
enon of capitalism (Angelis 2007). These also remain pivotal. But be-
tween our now cherished dialectic of “expanded reproduction” and
“accumulation by dispossession” (Harvey 2003) are those knowledges
and associated practices committed to the mapping, quantifying, and
rationalizing of human and extra-human natures in service to capital
accumulation. Thus the trinity: abstract social labor, abstract social
nature, primitive accumulation. This is the relational core of capitalist
world-praxis. And the work of this unholy trinity? To produce
Cheap Natures. Extend the zone of appropriation. In sum, to deliver
labor, food, energy, and raw materials—the Four Cheaps—faster
than the accumulating mass of surplus capital derived from the ex-
ploitation of labor-power. Why? Because the rate of exploitation of
labor-power (within the commodity system) tends to exhaust the life-
making capacities that enter into the immediate production of value.</p>
<p>In a world treated as boundless, capital
as a whole has evinced a cumulative, but cyclically punctuated,
tendency to search out and appropriate new, “physically uncor-
rupted” zones of cheap labor, food, energy, and raw materials.
Exhaustion signals a rising value composition of capital, and the
inflection point of decline for a given production complex to supply a
growing stream of unpaid work to regional accumulation.
To the
degree that “foreign preserves” can be identified and dominated, the
relative “degeneration of the industrial population” matters little.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We can now connect the dots between the rise of capitalism and
the emergence of the law of value. Value relations incorporate a
double movement to exploitation and appropriation. Within the com-
modity system, the exploitation of labor-power reigns supreme, but
this supremacy is only possible, given its tendency toward
self-exhaustion, to the degree that the appropriation of uncommodified natures
counteracts this tendency. This has been difficult to discern because
value relations are necessarily much broader than the immediate
production of the value form (the commodity). The generalization of
commodity production has proceeded through an expansionary web
of value relations whose scope and scale extends well beyond production.
The problem of capitalist development is one of the uneven
globalization of wage-work dialectically joined to the “generalization of
its conditions of reproduction”. The centrality of wage-work
in certain Marxist perspectives is not wrong but par-
tial, given the unsustainability of the circuit of capital as closed system.
The difficulty in pursuing this alternative analysis has been
rooted in the dualisms immanent to modern thought; for to construct
capitalism in this fashion is to transcend the man/woman,
nature/society boundaries upon which the whole edifice of modernist
thought depends. For not
only do we need to unify the distinctive but mutually formative
dialectics of human work under capitalism through the nexus of
paid/unpaid work, or “productive” and “reproductive” work. We also
need to recognize that capitalism’s dynamism has owed everything to
appropriating and co-producing ever more creative configurations of
human and extra-human work across the <em>longue durée</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Apropriation vs Plunder</strong></p>
<p>Appropriating cheap natures was and is a far more creative act
than the dependencia language of plunder allows (e.g., Clark and
Foster 2009). “Appropriation” represents a productive activity every
bit as much as “exploitation.”</p>
<p>Enabled a rising rate of surplus
value by treating the land, <em>simultaneously</em>, as a force of production and
a “free gift.”</p>
<p>It did not matter that horrific levels of mortality accompanied
this rising labor productivity so long as the costs of
appropriation—through indigenous and African slave trades—were
sufficiently low.</p>
<p>Sugar and wheat frontiers remade the world only through
extraordinary movements of capital, knowledge, and humans, each
movement a mighty expenditure of energy aimed at transforming na-
ture’s work into the bourgeoisie’s value.</p>
<p>Coal and oil are dramatic
examples of this process of appropriating unpaid work, understood
in such a relational framework.</p>
<p>The “fertility” of
cheap natures was the pedestal for productivity advance within the
commodity zone.</p>
<p>One of the key
reasons why capitalism was able to consolidate across the early mod-
ern era was its ability to appropriate the astounding realities, and
realize the extraordinary potentialities, of uncommodified natures
worldwide.</p>
<p>The introduction of Cheap
Food, as civilizational strategy, “acts like an increase in fixed capital.”</p>
<p>Historical capitalism has been able to resolve its recurrent
crises because territorialist and capitalist agencies have been able to
extend the zone of appropriation faster than the zone of exploitation.
This has allowed capitalism to successively overcome seemingly
insuperable “natural limits” through the coercively-enforced and
scientifically-enabled restoration of the Four Cheaps: labor-power,
food, energy, and raw materials. The Four Cheaps are produced by
effecting “accumulation by appropriation” faster than “accumulation
by capitalization.” This is possible on a planet where capitalization is
limited and most life reproduces without the help of capital: the
reality of early but not twenty-first century capitalism. Hence, the
centrality of the frontier and imperialism in capital accumulation.
Significant enlargements in the zone of appropriation resolve capitalism’s
crises by simultaneously reducing the value composition of produc-
tion, expanding physical output, and opening new spheres of capital
investment. All of this can proceed so long as capitalization is
checked, and appropriation liberated. This is, indeed, the history of
capital, empire, and science in the modern world: every new era of
capitalism brings with it a new industrialization, a new imperialism, a
new science.</p>
<p>A new industrialization. A new imperialism. A new science . . . a
new nature?</p>
<p><strong>Historical Nature</strong></p>
<p>The convention, even among radicals, is to see nature as
“out there.” This is Nature as a set of resources and extra-human
relations to be mobilized and treated sustainably or unsustainably. This
is indeed one of the realities we must deal with. It is how capital views
nature. It is capital’s civilizational <em>project</em> to bring reality into line with
this vision. Its geography is the geography of nature-in-capitalism.
Nature as contained, controlled, rationally coordinated. At another
level of abstract, the web of life works as we all experience it to work:
our “environment,” all that surrounds us and flows through us. Here
is nature as a whole; we are of it, and “it” shapes all our lives—the
lives of civilizations and “big structures” as well. Its geography is the
geography of capitalism-in-nature. This is the <em>process</em> of historical
capitalism. It is messy, cyclical, and full of surprises.</p>
<p>Capitalism’s law of value therefore represents a project that creates
a new <em>historical nature</em>: for the capitalist era and for its successive
phases of development.</p>
<p>The illusion is to see capitalist agencies developing new
“ecological” regimes just as they have developed new trade regimes or
geopolitical arrangements.</p>
<p>Like Arrighi, I see successive long centuries of capitalist develop-
ment as central to the story of capitalism: capitalism does not “auto-
matically” restructure (Arrighi and Silver 1999). My periodization—
readers will detect a familial resemblance to Arrighi’s model—looks
something like this: 1) a Germanic-Iberian cycle (c. 1451–1648), in
which the expansionary phase turns to relative decline after the 1557
financial crisis; 2) a Dutch-led cycle (c. 1560s–1740s), in which de-
cline sets in after 1680; 3) a British-led cycle, c. 1680s–1910s), with
relative decline after 1873; 4) an American-led cycle (c. 1870s–
1980s), with relative decline after 1971; and 5) a neoliberal cycle that
commenced in the 1970s.</p>
<p>We do not yet know
how to reconstruct the narrative in a way that recognizes the double
internality of capitalism-in-nature/nature-in-capitalism.</p>
<p>We may now derive a working proposition: the law of value is a
way of organizing nature.</p>
<p>Are not the two common
usages of value—as morality and economy—implied in capitalism’s
law of value?</p>
<p>I do not propose a revision of Marx’s law of value in a strict
sense: the substance of capital is abstract social labor. But the rela-
tions that make abstract labor’s growth possible cannot be reduced
to the economic sphere; they must be grounded in the technics of cap-
italist power and the conditions for the expanded reproduction of
capital on a world-scale. Neither an adequate history of capitalism,
nor a sufficiently dynamic theory of capitalist limits, is possible within
an economistic reading of the law of value.</p>
<p>Capitalism, as project, seeks to create a world in the image of cap-
ital, in which all elements of human and extra-human nature are ef-
fectively interchangeable. In the fantasy of neoclassical economics,
one “factor” (money, land, resources) can be substituted for another;
the elements of production can be moved easily and effortlessly
across global space (Perelman 2007). This effort to create a world in
the image of capital is what I call capitalism’s correspondence project,
through which capital seeks to compel the rest of the world to corre-
spond to its desire for a universe of “economic equivalence.”</p>
<p>Extra-human natures, too, resist the grim compulsions of economic
equivalence: superweeds frustrate genetically-modified agriculture;
animals resist their assigned roles as objects and forces of production.
In this way, capitalism’s correspondence project meets up with all man-
ner of contending and contentious visions and resistances to create
a historical process full of contradictions.</p>
<p>As the flurry of news reports on the “superweeds” sweeping across the
GMO soy zones of the United States revealed in 2010–11, biological
natures now appear to be evolving faster than the capacity of capital
to control them.</p>
<p>These paired movements of geographical expansion and restruc-
turing are at the core of capitalism’s successive spatial fixes, necessary
to resolve successive conjonctures of overaccumulation. They are consti-
tuted through a double movement: 1) the widening and deepening
the zone of commodification (value production/abstract social labor),
and 2) on an even greater scale, the widening and deepening the zone
of appropriation. This latter movement turns on the production of ab-
stract social nature. Abstract social nature is produced through the
biopolitical, geographical, and scientific-technical knowledges and
practices necessary to secure the conditions for renewing the Four
Cheaps. This means that new “frontiers” of unpaid work must be iden-
tified, and then pressed into the service of capital accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Capitalsim as a <em>project</em> vs Capitalism as a <em>process</em> </strong></p>
<p>This reading of the law of value allows us to see the difference
between capitalism as historical project and capitalism as historical
process. As project, capitalist civilization produces both symbolic
forms and material relations that lend Cartesian dualism its kernel of
truth; the law of value does indeed reproduce a way of seeing reality
that is dualist. Capitalism, as project creates the idea and even a cer-
tain reality of “the” environment as an external object. The idea of
the environment as external object—rather than as oikeios, the crea-
tive relation of species and environment-making—is not false, but ra-
ther a historical creation of the capitalist world-ecology. The mistake
of environmental studies has been to confuse the real historical cre-
ation of the idea of environment as external object with the reality: the
reality that environments are always inside and outside of us, material
and symbolic at once. This is why I emphasize capitalism as a dialectic
of project (what the law of value wishes to do, in creating a world that
corresponds of value’s interchangeability), and process. Capitalism,
as world-historical process, is a co-production of humans and the rest
of nature. This co-produced historical reality compels the capitalist
project to deal with nature (as oikeios) no matter the utopian fantasies
of value and its universe of economic equivalents. As a process of cap-
ital accumulation, capitalism must relentlessly dissolve the bounda-
ries of life in its voracious internalization and reconfiguration of un-
paid work—human and extra-human alike —in service to the utopian project of endless
valorization.</p>
<p>For if the production of capital
has been the strategic pivot of capitalism, to an even greater extent
accumulation has unfolded through the appropriation of planetary
work/energy. Such appropriation—yes of cheap resources (“taps”)
but also of cheap garbage (“sinks”)—does not produce capital as
“value,” but it does produce the relations, spaces, and work/energy
that make value possible.</p>
<p>The appropriation of Cheap Na-
tures has not only compelled capital to seek out new sources of cheap
labor-power, food, energy, and raw materials, but to enclose the at-
mosphere as a gigantic dumping ground for greenhouse gases. This
enclosure—a relation of capital-in-nature—is today generating barri-
ers to capital accumulation that are unprecedented, especially in ag-
riculture. And at the risking of putting too fine a point on matters,
this enclosure of the atmosphere is a class relation: not only as cause-
effect sequence (“the capitalists did it”!) but as a necessary condition
of world class relations over the past two centuries.</p>
<p>The geographical flexibility and historical evolution of capitalism as
world-ecology.</p>
<p>Value operates through a dialectic of exploitation and appropri-
ation that illuminates capitalism’s peculiar relation with, and within,
nature. The relations of exploitation produce abstract social labor.
The relations of appropriation, producing abstract social nature, en-
abled the expanded accumulation of this abstract social labor.</p>
