\begin{quote}
``Capitalism'' means ``an economy controlled by whoever already has capital''
\end{quote}

Capitalism is a human invention

\emph{Rulers \textbf{invented} capitalism} basically to
extract more from the peasant communities by compeling farmers to extract more from the land
and expelling surplus land labour into new industries.

Evolving Capitalism.

\begin{quote}
Jason Hickel: People assume that capitalism is a system
defined by markets and trade.
But these pre-existed capitalism by thousands of years.
What distinguishes capitalism is that it is organized around
perpetual expansion and accumulation,
which is euphemistically referred to as ``growth''.
This requires:
-enclosure to generate proletarianization
-artificial scarcity to generate competitive productivity
-an extractive relationship with nature and labour to enable surplus accumulation
-``frontiers'' where nature and labour can be cheapened and costs externalized
Such a system is incompatible with ecology, and incompatible with any vision
for a world that's free of poverty, exploitation and structural inequality.
We need to have an open conversation about whether such a system is actually
worth clinging to in the 21st century.
\end{quote}

.

\begin{quote}
Kate Raworth: It's just an ultimate absurdity that in the 21st century,
when we know we are witnessing the death of the living world
unless we utterly transform the way we live,
that death of the living world is called `an environmental externality.'
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{accumulation-growth}{%
\chapter{Accumulation (Growth)}\label{accumulation-growth}}

Accumulation is \emph{elite accumulation}!

Growth is a problem over and above capitalism.
Like it not, growth is bound to come to an end,
the question is how;
and whether this will happen soon or too late to avert planetary disasters.
There is too much superfluous activity under capitalism,
which serves nothing else but the need of capitalists
to extract surplus value and make profits.

Growth requires accumulation and accumulation comes with exploitation.

Like a snake biting its own tail, economic growth is limited because it is inevitably based on the unsustainable exploitation of reproductive labour and ecosystem provisioning.

If socialism means the end of exploitation,
it also means the end of endless accumulation.
Again: this is socialism without growth.

\href{https://braveneweurope.com/timothee-parrique-giorgos-kallis-degrowth-socialism-without-growth}{Kallis-Parrique}

Degrowth from a standpoint of a purely rational approach to fundamentally shifting an economy that is currently heating the world to death, guaranteeing centuries of mass death and destruction. The only way to slow the rapid race to collapse civilization and accelerate extinctions is to stop the omnicidal political economy that rules the globe. Given the natural limits that thermodynamics and terrestrial ecologies impose on human economies and non-human populations, degrowth is inevitable: it's just a matter of deciding whether human agency will play a positive, benevolent role in the process, or continue to maximize the chaos and violence involved.

\href{https://www.the-trouble.com/content/2021/2/11/ecosocialism-is-the-horizon-degrowth-is-the-way}{On Hickel's `Less is More'}

Capitalism has always required ``frontiers'', external to itself,
from which to extract cheap nature and cheap labour.
It should come as no surprise that such a system produces
perpetual ecological crises and keeps most of the world's
population below subsistence levels of income. (Jason Hickel)

What we call ``growth'' is ultimately a process of enclosure, commodification,
and elite accumulation.
That anyone would regard this as a reasonable objective for the economy,
or indeed as a proxy for human progress,
is testament to the totalizing ideological power of capital. (Jason Hickel)

The apparent paradox of high and rising average
standard of living despite a mounting environmental toll has
come at a great cost to the stability of humanity's medium-
and long-term life-support system. In other words, humanity is
running an ecological Ponzi scheme in which society robs nature
and future generations to pay for boosting incomes in the short
term

\chapter{Affluence}\label{affluence}}

\emph{Memo}

Allocating environmental impacts to consumers is consistent
with the perspective that consumers are the ultimate drivers of
production, with their purchasing decisions setting in motion a
series of trade transactions and production activities, rippling
along complex international supply-chain networks 5 . However,
allocating impacts to consumers does not necessarily imply a
systemic causal understanding of which actor should be held
most responsible for these impacts. Responsibility may lie with
the consumer or with an external actor, like the state, or in
structural relations between actors. Scholars of sustainable
consumption have shown that consumers often have little control
over environmentally damaging decisions along supply chains 6 ,
however they often do have control over making a consumption
decision in the first place. Whilst in Keynesian-type economics
consumer demand drives production, Marxian political econom-
ics as well as environmental sociology views the economy as
supply dominated.

Remarkably, consumption (and to a lesser extent population)
growth have mostly outrun any beneficial effects of changes in
technology over the past few decades

Considering that the lifestyles of
wealthy citizens are characterised by an abundance of choice,
convenience and comfort, we argue that the determinant and
driver we have referred to in previous sections as consumption, is
more aptly labelled as affluence.

A suitable concept to address the ecological dimension
is the widely established avoid-shift-improve framework outlined
by Creutzig et al.~43 . Its focus on the end-use service, such as
mobility, nutrition or shelter, allows for a multi-dimensional
analysis of potential impact reductions beyond sole technological
change. This analysis can be directed at human need satisfaction
or decent living standards---an alternative perspective put for-
ward for curbing environmental crises 44,45 . Crucially, this per-
spective allows us to consider different provisioning systems (e.g.
states, markets, communities and households) and to differentiate
between superfluous consumption, which is consumption that
does not contribute to needs satisfaction, and necessary con-
sumption which can be related to satisfying human needs

Carbon emissions and
material use are globally more unequally distributed when
accounted for as footprints. In contrast to territorial allocations,
footprints attribute environmental burdens to the final consumer,
no matter where the initial environmental pressure has occurred.
Here, international trade is responsible for shifting burdens from
mostly low-income developing-world producers to high-income
developed-world consumers

\emph{Growth imperatives} are active at multiple levels, making the pursuit of
economic growth (net investment, i.e.~investment above depre-
ciation) a necessity for different actors and leading to social and
economic instability in the absence of it 7,52,60 . Following a
Marxian perspective as put forward by Pirgmaier and Steinber-
ger 61 , growth imperatives can be attributed to capitalism as the
currently dominant socio-economic system in affluent
countries 7,51,62 , although this is debated by other scholars

The average energy intensity of labour is
now twice as high as in 1950. As long as a firm has a
competitive advantage, there is a strong incentive to sell as much
as possible.

Under normal economic conditions, this
capitalist competition is expected to lead to aggregate growth
dynamics

If labour productivity continuously rises, then
aggregate economic growth becomes necessary to keep employ-
ment constant, otherwise technological unemployment results.
This creates one of the imperatives for capitalist states to foster
aggregate growth, since with worsening economic conditions and
high unemployment, tax revenues shrink, e.g.~from labour and
value-added taxes, while social security expenditures rise

Consumers
usually increase their consumption in tune with increasing
production 60 . This process can be at least in part explained by
substantial advertising efforts by firms

Following this analysis, it is not surprising that the growth
paradigm is hegemonic, i.e.~the perception that economic growth
solves all kinds of societal problems, that it equals progress, power
and welfare and that it can be made practically endless through
some form of supposedly green or sustainable growth

Taken
together, the described dynamics create multiple dependencies of
workers, firms and states on a well-functioning capital accumula-
tion and thus wield more material, institutional and discursive
power (e.g.~for political lobbying) to capitalists who are usually
the most affluent consumers

An individual's happiness correlates
positively with their own income but negatively with the peer
group's income 71 and that unequal access to positional goods
fosters rising consumption 52 . This endless process is a core part
of capitalism as it keeps social momentum and consumption high
with affluent consumers driving aspirations and hopes of social
ascent in low-affluence segments 70,72 . The positional consump-
tion behaviour of the super-affluent thus drives consumption
norms across the population

Degrowth is defined here as ``an equitable
downscaling of throughput {[}that is the energy and resource flows
through an economy, strongly coupled to GDP{]}, with a
concomitant securing of wellbeing`` 59,p7 , aimed at a subsequent
downscaled steady-state economic system that is socially just and
in balance with ecological limits

Den kapitalistischen Zentren bleibt dann nur noch der Versuch, ihre Lebensweise durch Abschottung und Ausgrenzung exklusiv zu stabilisieren. Damit bringen die Vertreter dieser Politik, die sich in der Regel selbst als „bürgerliche Mitte`` etikettieren, genau das hervor, was sie als ihren Widerpart begreifen: autoritäre, rassistische und nationalistische Bestrebungen. Dass diese derzeit überall erstarken, liegt auch daran, dass sie sich in der Krise als die eigentlichen, weil konsequenteren Garanten jener Exklusivität inszenieren können, die im Normalbetrieb der imperialen Lebensweise immer schon angelegt ist. Und im Unterschied zu ihren „bürgerlichen`` Konkurrenten vermögen sie ihrer Wählerschaft ein Angebot zu machen, das diese auf eine subalterne Position festlegt und sie gleichzeitig aus ihrer postdemokratischen Passivierung befreit. Nora Räthzel hat diesen Mechanismus im Hinblick auf den Rassismus, wie er sich im Deutschland der frühen 1990er Jahre artikulierte, treffend als „rebellierende Selbstunterwerfung`` bezeichnet. Den Akteuren wird es dabei ermöglicht, „sich als Handelnde in Verhältnissen zu konstituieren, denen sie ausgeliefert sind``.

Es reicht nicht mehr, eine „grüne Revolution``{[}11{]} oder einen neuen „Gesellschaftsvertrag``{[}12{]} einzufordern. Denn dies lässt, der starken Rhetorik zum Trotz, die politische Ökonomie der Probleme sowie die imperiale Lebensweise unangetastet. Auch greift es zu kurz, implizit oder explizit darauf zu setzen, dass „die Politik`` aus der unabweisbaren, da wissenschaftlich immer genauer belegten Tatsache der ökologischen Krise endlich die richtigen Konsequenzen zieht. Damit übersieht man, dass der Staat kein möglicher Gegenpol, sondern ein wesentlicher Garant für die institutionelle Absicherung der imperialen Lebensweise ist.

Stattdessen kommt es zunächst darauf an, die ökologische Krise als deutlichen Hinweis auf ein grundsätzlicheres Problem anzuerkennen: Die Produktions- und Konsumnormen des globalen Nordens, die sich mit dem Kapitalismus herausgebildet und schließlich verallgemeinert haben, lassen sich selbst in ihrer ökologisch modernisierten Variante nur auf Kosten von immer mehr Gewalt, ökologischer Zerstörung und menschlichem Leid aufrechterhalten -- und auch dies nur in einem kleinen Teil der Welt. Aufgrund der autoritären, weiter auf Inwertsetzung der Natur und gesellschaftliche Spaltung setzenden Politik erleben wir derzeit eine beispiellose Anhäufung der Widersprüche. Die Reproduktion der Gesellschaft und ihrer biophysikalischen Grundlagen kann über den kapitalistischen Wachstumsimperativ immer weniger gesichert werden. Wir erleben eine Krise des Krisenmanagements, eine Hegemonie- und Staatskrise.

\section{The New American Aristocracy}\label{the-new-american-aristocracy}}

\emph{Memo}

Understanding America's evolving class system.

Perhaps the best evidence for the power of an aristocracy is
the degree of resentment it provokes.

The meritocratic class has mastered the old trick of consolidating
wealth and passing privilege along at the expense of other people's
children. We are not innocent bystanders to the growing
concentration of wealth in our time. We are the principal
accomplices in a process that is slowly strangling the economy,
destabilizing American politics, and eroding democracy.
We seem to be the last to notice just
how rapidly we've morphed, or what we've morphed into.
The arc of the narrative is simple: Once we
were equal, but now we are divided.

Our delusions of merit now prevent us from recognizing the nature of the
problem that our emergence as a class represents. We tend to think
that the victims of our success are just the people excluded from the
club. But history shows quite clearly that, in the kind of game we're
playing, everybody loses badly in the end.

We have left the 90 percent
in the dust---and we've been quietly tossing down roadblocks behind
us to make sure that they never catch up.

The 2010s look much like the 1920s

Economic mobility in the land of
opportunity {[}US{]} is not high, and it's going down.
In America, the game is half over
once you've selected your parents.

We are the people of good family, good health, good schools, good
neighborhoods, and good jobs. We may want to call ourselves the
``5Gs'' rather than the 9.9 percent.
We are so far from the not-so-
good people on all of these dimensions, we are beginning to resemble
a new species.
The polite term for the process is assortative mating.
Rising inequality decreases the
number of suitably wealthy mates even as it increases the reward for
finding one and the penalty for failing to do so.
For most of us, the process is happily invisible.

It's one of the
delusions of our meritocratic class, however, to assume that if our
actions are individually blameless, then the sum of our actions will be
good for society.

A process that is creating two distinct forms of life in our society.

We prefer to signal our
status by talking about our organically nourished bodies, the awe-
inspiring feats of our offspring, and the ecological correctness of our
neighborhoods. We have figured out how to launder our money
through higher virtues.

We're leaving the 90 percent and their offspring far behind in a cloud
of debts and bad life choices that they somehow can't stop themselves
from making.

The Gatsby Curve has managed to reproduce itself in social,
physiological, and cultural capital. Put more accurately: There is only
one curve, but it operates through a multiplicity of forms of wealth.

Rising inequality does not follow from a hidden law of economics, as
the otherwise insightful Thomas Piketty suggested when he claimed
that the historical rate of return on capital exceeds the historical rate
of growth in the economy. Inequality necessarily entrenches itself
through other, nonfinancial, intrinsically invidious forms of wealth
and power. We use these other forms of capital to project our
advantages into life itself. We look down from our higher virtues in
the same way the English upper class looked down from its taller
bodies, as if the distinction between superior and inferior were an
artifact of nature. That's what aristocrats do.

According to a 2017
study, 38 elite colleges---among them five of the Ivies---had more
students from the top 1 percent than from the bottom 60 percent. In
his 2014 book, Excellent Sheep, William Deresiewicz, a former
English professor at Yale, summed up the situation nicely: ``Our new
multiracial, gender-neutral meritocracy has figured out a way to make
itself hereditary.''

In the United States, the premium that college graduates earn over
their non-college-educated peers in young adulthood exceeds 70
percent. The return on education is 50 percent higher than what it
was in 1950.

One of the stories we tell ourselves is that the premium is the reward
for the knowledge and skills the education provides us. Another,
usually unfurled after a round of drinks, is that the premium is a
reward for the superior cranial endowments we possessed before
setting foot on campus. We are, as some sociologists have delicately
put it, a ``cognitive elite.''

the fact is that degree holders earn so much more than the rest
not primarily because they are better at their job, but because they
mostly take different categories of jobs. Well over half of Ivy League
graduates, for instance, typically go straight into one of four career
tracks that are generally reserved for the well educated: finance,
management consulting, medicine, or law.
To keep it simple, let's just
say that there are two types of occupations in the world: those whose
members have collective influence in setting their own pay, and those
whose members must face the music on their own

Americans now turn over \$1 of
every \$12 in GDP to the financial sector; in the 1950s, the bankers
were content to keep only \$1 out of \$40.
The public underwrites the
risks; the financial gurus take a seat at the casino; and it's heads they
win, tails we lose. The financial system we now have is not a product
of nature. It has been engineered, over decades, by powerful bankers,
for their own benefit and for that of their posterity.

when educated people with excellent credentials band
together to advance their collective interest, it's all part of serving the
public good by ensuring a high quality of service, establishing fair
working conditions, and giving merit its due. That's why we do it
through ``associations,'' and with the assistance of fellow professionals
wearing white shoes. When working-class people do it---through
unions---it's a violation of the sacred principles of the free market. It's
thuggish and anti-modern. Imagine if workers hired consultants and
``compensation committees,'' consisting of their peers at other
companies, to recommend how much they should be paid. The result
would be---well, we know what it would be, because that's what
CEOs do.

education has been reduced to a private
good, justifiable only by the increments in graduates' paychecks.
Instead of uniting and enriching us, it divides and impoverishes

If the system can be gamed, well then, our ability to game
the system has become the new test of merit.

Aristocrats always prefer the invisible kind of
government. It leaves them free to exercise their privileges.

Real estate alone
may account for essentially all of the increase in wealth concentration
over the past half century.
These are the gold mines of our new economy.

Local zoning
regulation imposes excessive restrictions on housing development and
drives up prices. What is less well understood is how central the
process of depopulating the economic core of the nation is to the
intertwined stories of rising inequality and falling social mobility.

saving the local environment, preserving
the historic character of the neighborhood, and avoiding
overcrowding. In reality, it's about hoarding power and opportunity
inside the walls of our own castles. This is what aristocracies do.

Zip code is who we are. It defines our style, announces our values,
establishes our status, preserves our wealth, and allows us to pass it
along to our children. It's also slowly strangling our economy and
killing our democracy.

Americans have
trouble telling the difference between a social critique and a personal
insult. Thus, a writer points to a broad social problem with complex
origins, and the reader responds with, ``What, you want to punish me
for my success?''

It has taken less than one lifetime
for the (never fully formed) meritocracy to evolve into a (fledgling)
aristocracy
Class accretes faster than we think. It's our awareness that
lags,

We have intuited one of the fundamental paradoxes of
life on the Gatsby Curve: The greater the inequality, the less your
money buys.

The source of the trouble, considered more deeply, is that we have
traded rights for privileges. We're willing to strip everyone, including
ourselves, of the universal right to a good education, adequate health
care, adequate representation in the workplace, genuinely equal
opportunities, because we think we can win the game. But who,
really, in the end, is going to win this slippery game of escalating
privileges?

The political theology of the meritocracy has no room for
resentment. We are taught to run the competition of life with our
eyes on the clock and not on one another, as if we were each alone. If
someone scores a powerboat on the Long Island waterways, so much
the better for her. The losers will just smile and try harder next time.

Perhaps the best evidence for the power of an aristocracy is to be
found in the degree of resentment it provokes.
The surest sign of an
increase in resentment is a rise in political division and instability.
The 2016 presidential election marked a decisive moment in the
history of resentment in the United States. In the person of Donald
Trump, resentment entered the White House. It rode in on the back
of an alliance between a tiny subset of super-wealthy 0.1 percenters
(not all of them necessarily American) and a large number of 90
percenters who stand for pretty much everything the 9.9 percent are
not.
The counties that supported Hillary Clinton represented an
astonishing 64 percent of the GDP, while Trump counties accounted
for a mere 36 percent.
the median home value in Clinton counties was
\$250,000, while the median in Trump counties was \$154,000.
There's a reason why one of
Trump's favorite words is \emph{unfair}. That's the only word resentment
wants to hear.
Trump lost college-educated white voters by a
humiliating 17 percent margin. But he got revenge with non-college-
educated whites, whom he captured by a stomping 36 percent
margin

The historian Richard Hofstadter drew attention to Anti-
intellectualism in American Life in 1963; Susan Jacoby warned in
2008 about The Age of American Unreason; and Tom Nichols
announced The Death of Expertise in 2017. In Trump, the age of
unreason has at last found its hero. The ``self-made man'' is always the
idol of those who aren't quite making it. He is the sacred
embodiment of the American dream, the guy who answers to nobody,
the poor man's idea of a rich man. It's the educated phonies this
group can't stand.

We 9.9 percenters are the staff that runs the machine that
funnels resources from the 90 percent to the 0.1 percent.
We've been happy to take our cut of the spoils.

The politics of resentment is a means of increasing
inequality, not reducing it.

we are next in line for the chopping
block. As the population of the resentful expands, the circle of joy
near the top gets smaller.

The defining challenge of our time is to renew the promise of
American democracy by reversing the calcifying effects of accelerating
inequality.

The kind of change that really matters is going to require action
from the federal government. That which creates monopoly power
can also destroy it; that which allows money into politics can also
take it out; that which has transferred power from labor to capital can
transfer it back

Casting himself as the barbarian at the gate, his years stoking the furies of racial resentment, anti-establishment contempt and warped conspiracy theories reached their natural conclusion in the ``American carnage'' he once promised to end.

Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican national committee, told the Guardian: ``We stopped paying attention to what was happening around us. We started taking for granted each other and we weren't listening to the things that were driving people's pain and anguish and frustrations. Our political leadership became absorbed in their own self-interest, in their own re-elections.

The erosion of American democracy has multiple causes -- inequality, racism, distrust of institutions, polarisation, media, social media -- that predate Trump and will survive him.

``There's no one thing you can single out with any absolute truth as definitive. It is like making a gumbo and finding the worst ingredients possible and just scratching your head and trying to figure out, why doesn't this taste right?

Trump has tapped into the frustration of the sliding status of a group of less well-educated whites

As a proportion of GDP, American corporate profits are higher
than they have been at any time since 1929.

Pulling ahead of their rivals in one area after another and building up powerful defences against competition, including enormous cash piles equivalent to 10\% of GDP in America and as much as 47\% in Japan.

In the 1980s and 1990s management gurus pointed to the ``demise of size'' as big companies seemed to be giving way to a much more entrepreneurial economy.
Giants such as AT\&T were broken up and state-owned firms were privatised. High-tech companies emerged from nowhere. Peter Drucker, a veteran management thinker, announced that ``the Fortune 500 {[}list of the biggest American companies{]} is over.'' That chimed with the ideas of Ronald Coase, an academic who had argued in ``The Nature of the Firm'' (1937) that companies make sense only when they can provide the services concerned more cheaply than the market can.

But now size seems to matter again. The McKinsey Global Institute, the consultancy's research arm, calculates that 10\% of the world's public companies generate 80\% of all profits.
Firms with more than \$1 billion in annual revenue account for nearly 60\% of total global revenues and 65\% of market capitalisation.

The share of nominal GDP generated by the Fortune 100 biggest American companies rose from about 33\% of GDP in 1994 to 46\% in 2013, and the Fortune 100's share of the revenues generated by the Fortune 500 went up from 57\% to 63\% over the same period. The number of listed companies in America nearly halved between 1997 and 2013, from 6,797 to 3,485, according to Gustavo Grullon of Rice University and two colleagues, reflecting the trend towards consolidation and growing size. Sales by the median listed public company are almost three times as big as they were 20 years ago. Profit margins have increased in direct proportion to the concentration of the market.

Startups, meanwhile, have found it harder to get off the ground. Robert Litan, of the Council on Foreign Relations, and Ian Hathaway, of the Brookings Institution, note that the number of startups is lower than at any time since the late 1970s, and that more companies die than are born, pushing up their average age.

The superstar effect is particularly marked in the knowledge economy. In Silicon Valley a handful of giants are enjoying market shares and profit margins not seen since the robber barons in the late 19th century. ``Competition is for losers,'' says Peter Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal, a payments system, and the first outside investor in Facebook. On Wall Street the five largest banks have increased their share of America's banking assets from 25\% in 2000 to 45\% today.

Today's superstar companies are big in different ways from their predecessors. In the old days companies with large revenues and global footprints almost always had lots of assets and employees. Some superstar companies, such as Walmart and Exxon, still do. But digital companies with huge market valuations and market shares typically have few assets.

Yet even ``old'' big companies employ far fewer people than they used to. Exxon, the world's most successful oil company, has cut back its workforce from 150,000 in the 1960s to less than half that today, despite having merged with a giant rival, Mobil

The ``new'' big companies are becoming more like the corporations of yore. High-tech companies often give senior jobs to former Washington insiders and employ armies of lobbyists. Many modern superstar companies park their money in offshore hideaways and devote considerable efforts to keeping down their tax bills. Superstar companies tend to excel at everything they do---including squeezing as much as they can out of government while paying the lowest possible taxes.

The age of entrepreneurialism, ushered in by Britain's Margaret Thatcher and America's Ronald Reagan, is giving way to an age of corporate consolidation even as most companies are becoming more virtual

\section{Land Oligopoly}\label{land-oligopoly}}

``When the billionaires buy up all the farmland,
you can feel the late stages of civilization collapse'' (Joe Brewer)

Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world has been quietly
snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. ---
enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.
Gates, who has a net worth of nearly \$121 billion according to Forbes,
has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states.
His largest holdings are in Louisiana (69,071 acres), Arkansas (47,927 acres)
and Nebraska (20,588 acres).
Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land
on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.

This is not Gates' only foray into agriculture.
In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced
\$306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture
among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
The foundation has further invested in the development and
proliferation of ``super crops'' resistant to climate change
and higher-yield dairy cows.

It is not entirely clear how Gates' farmland is being used,
or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation.
(Cascade did not return Forbes' request for comment.)
However, there is some indication that the land could be used
in a way that aligns with the foundation's values.
Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade,
is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes
sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections
of crops, soil and water resources.

While Gates may be the country's biggest farmland owner,
he by no means is the largest individual landowner.
In its list of 100 top American landowners,
The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone,
who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests.
CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land
across eight states.
Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale,
landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres,
mainly in west Texas.

Decoupling: \emph{the end of the correlation between increased economic production and
decreased environmental quality.}

\emph{Conclusion}

The needed decoupling does not occur! Not GLOBAL, not FAST-ENOUGH, not LONG-ENOUGH.

\begin{quote}
Decoupling as a main or single strategy to combine
economic and environmental aims should be judged as taking a very
large risk with our common future.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The claim that the economy can grow
while at the same time the ``environmental bads'' diminish needs further
support from sources other than empirical research literature. The
claim needs to be supported by detailed and concrete plans of structural
change that delineate how the future will be different from the past.
\end{quote}

\emph{Memo}

Distinctions between impact and resource decoupling,
and relative and absolute decoupling are a staple in the
literature.
Decoupling the growth of economy can be discussed
in terms of resource use (resource decoupling) or environmental impact
(impact decoupling).

An important conceptual distinction to be made is between absolute
(strong) and relative (weak) decoupling. Relative decoupling means
that economic growth is faster than the growth of environmental da-
mage or resource use, even though the latter may still be growing.

Absolute decoupling, in turn, means that the economy is growing while
the amount of resource use and/or environmental impact is decreasing.
relative decoupling does not necessarily lead to ab-
solute decoupling. Relative decoupling due to, for instance, increased
material efficiency, may continue for long periods of time without ever
turning into absolute decoupling.

Relative decoupling is, by definition,
connected to increased impacts and/or resource use, so in order to
evaluate the pertinence of evidence of relative decoupling it is neces-
sary to investigate what are the structural reasons for the relative de-
coupling, and find out if they are such that they can continue and in-
tensify into absolute decoupling.

Local decoupling does not necessarily entail global decoupling.
Decoupling become problematic
when outsourcing and trade are taken into account

Making decoupling a continuous phenomenon is harder than achieving decoupling for a limited period of
time, as continuous decoupling entails permanent changes in structures
of production.
Only long-enough periods of analysis provide reliable information on prevailing trends.

One of the problems widely discussed
with relation to sectoral decoupling is the phenomenon of \emph{rebound} or
so-called \emph{Jevons' paradox}.

It is easy to achieve resource decoupling in comparison
to impact decoupling. An economy may relatively easily replace a
harmful substance, such as ozone-depleting CFC gases, and thus be
absolutely decoupled from the specific impact. Indeed, such a decou-
pling may be achieved by increased material use, if the use of the re-
placement demand more resources, such as energy. In contrast, a de-
crease in resource use, whether in terms of DMC or TMR or something
similar, demands a wider-reaching change in the functioning of the
economy.

Decoupling CO2 emissions from GDP can very well coexist with unsustainable environmental
impacts and resource use

Decoupling is a measure of ecological efficiency, not one of sus-
tainability: even an absolutely decoupled economy can transgress pla-
netary boundaries either through its impacts or its resource use.

Moreover, as climate change threatens to pass the tipping points
after which efforts of mitigation become harder (Lenton, 2011; Lenton
et al., 2019), the decoupling of CO2 emissions from economic growth
has to be sufficiently fast.

The most common case of absolute decoupling reported (50 articles)
is between CO2 emissions and economic growth. It is important to
notice, that none of these 50 studies explicitly study the possible effect
that trade and outsourcing have on national emission and GDP.

The literature finds evidence of impact decoupling, especially
between GHG emissions (such as COX and SOX emissions) in wealthy
countries for certain periods of time, but not of economy-wide resource
decoupling, least of all on the international and global scale. Quite the
opposite: there is evidence of increased material intensity and re-cou-
pling.

\emph{Vaden (abstract)}

\begin{quote}
The idea of decoupling ``environmental bads'' from ``economic goods'' has been proposed as a path towards
sustainability by organizations such as the OECD and UN. Scientific consensus reports on environmental impacts
(e.g., greenhouse gas emissions) and resource use give an indication of the kind of decoupling needed for
ecological sustainability: global, absolute, fast-enough and long-enough. This goal gives grounds for a cate-
gorisation of the different kinds of decoupling, with regard to their relevance. We conducted a survey of recent
(1990--2019) research on decoupling on Web of Science and reviewed the results in the research according to the
categorisation. The reviewed 179 articles contain evidence of absolute impact decoupling, especially between
CO2 (and SOX) emissions and evidence on geographically limited (national level) cases of absolute decoupling of
land and blue water use from GDP, but not of economy-wide resource decoupling, neither on national nor
international scales. Evidence of the needed absolute global fast-enough decoupling is missing.

\hypertarget{degrowth}{%
\chapter{Degrowth}\label{degrowth}}

Degrowth redefines progress.
The goal is to achieve well-being for all,
in balance with the Earth's ecosystems,
and any step we take in this direction (i.e., degrowth) represents progress.

Degrowth is as anti-capitalist as it gets

The ideology of growth has become the powerhouse of modern capitalism and we do not understand why some socialists are reluctant to join the battle against a phenomenon that is socially divisive and ecologically unsustainable. A socialism without growth but with well-being as its goal is how we reconcile two of the most powerful concepts we have: capitalism and guaranteeing a future.

As is evident by now, we do use the C-word, a lot. Certain Marxist commentators have accused degrowth of never explicitly questioning capitalism. Phillips (2015 depicts degrowth as a ``small-scale steady-state capitalism.'' The degrowth project some would think resembles the film Downsizing (2017), where exuberant consumerism is made environmentally possible by shrinking people down to a few centimetres.

So, let us be clear: degrowth is not miniature capitalism with tiny corporations, tiny speculative financial instruments, and tiny free trade agreements. It is not austerity within capitalism. It is an alternative system of provision altogether -- not just smaller and slower, but different.

You may ask why focus on growth and not just capitalism? Well, try to compare the occurrence of ``economic growth'' versus ``capital accumulation'' in the news. As Gareth Dale has forcefully argued, economic growth is the ideology that has turned the specific interest of capital to grow (for returns, and for keeping social peace) into a generalized social objective assimilated by the population. This is not an ideology that will go away by refusing to confront it or beautifying it with nice adjectives. The fact that this ideology survived even the end of capitalism (or at least of a certain type of capitalism) in ex-socialist regimes should give pause for thought. Socialists who defend growth must also think twice whether they are redwashing capital, redressing the dreams that capitalism sells as socialist dreams.

Growth is the child of capitalism, but the child grew up and took over the head of the family. Capitalism's interest in accumulation is promoted and legitimised through -- and in the name of -- ``growth.'' The critique of growth is the most fundamental critique of capitalism -- one that criticises not only the means capitalism uses but the very ends it sells. This makes degrowth and (eco)socialism natural allies, not adversaries.

\href{https://braveneweurope.com/timothee-parrique-giorgos-kallis-degrowth-socialism-without-growth}{Kallis-Parrique}

If capitalism calls for scarcity in order to generate more growth, degrowth calls for the opposite: reversing artificial scarcities in order to remove growthist pressures, and indeed to render additional growth unnecessary. Expanding universal public services is key to this (i.e., the opposite of austerity). As for the problem of excess throughput: this is being driven by unnecessary industrial activity (in other words, industrial activity that is organized around exchange-value rather than use-value) and elite accumulation. So that's what we have to degrow.

Of course, one can imagine this being achieved by an authoritarian government, but it wouldn't work very well. The problem with any elitist state structure is that it is removed from the complex realities of regional ecology. You can't manage ecosystems with abstract planning (James Scott's work in Seeing Like a State is good on this); it requires the knowledge of people who have a relationship with the land\ldots{} it requires commoners. We know that when people have collective democratic control over local ecological commons they make decisions to sustain rather than liquidate them. That's the principle we need to build on.

Our relationship with nature will mimic the structure of our society. If we organize society around hierarchy, domination and extraction (which is true of both capitalism and any form of authoritarianism), then our relationship with nature will be hierarchical, dominating and extractive. But if we organize society around egalitarianism, reciprocity and care, then our relationship with nature will be egalitarian, reciprocal and caring. Every human society necessarily relies on nonhuman species; the question is, according to what principles do we incorporate them?

Degrowthism strikes a path that incorporates high-tech solutions
to build low-tech, low-harm economies.

Under capitalism, innovations that deliver efficiency improvements lead not to a reduction of energy and resource use, but rather to more energy and resource use, because the gains are reinvested to expand the process of production and consumption. In other words, growthism wipes out our most impressive improvements. When it comes to confronting ecological breakdown, we must realize that it's not our technology that's the problem, it's growth.

\emph{Action}

The first step is to amplify the voices of Indigenous leaders and activists who are already pointing in this direction. The Red Nation movement's tagline says ``All Relatives Forever'', with relatives here of course referring to both human and nonhuman persons. Consider the implications of such a politics; it is profound -- far more radical, and far more inspiring and enriching, than traditional leftist discourse.

The Rights of Nature movement is also promising; the more we talk about rivers, watersheds and ecosystems as persons, with rights to existence, the more this idea becomes thinkable. We don't have to wait for national governments to create such rights; in many places local councils have this power.

\emph{Fiction}

Ursula Le Guin's The Dispossessed. It's a story about a kind of ecosocialist society on another planet. The premise is that the ecosystem is primarily desert, so people have to find ways to sustain a flourishing society with relatively little material throughput. They do it with a firm commitment to egalitarianism, public goods, and direct democracy. They fiercely reject elite accumulation, which they see as dangerously wasteful. Because they do not measure civilization in terms of the quantity of stuff they consume (as our society does), they are free to focus on higher goals: philosophy, science and art. It's worth noting that Le Guin was the daughter of Alfred Kroeber, an anthropologist who spent his career learning from Indigenous communities in the American Southwest. These were people who saw egalitarianism and direct democracy as essential to survival in a desert ecosystem. Le Guin was clearly inspired by their approach to the world.

There's other literature that deals with degrowth themes, although without trying to portray a degrowth society. Michael Ende's Momo comes to mind. There's also Hayao Miyazaki's films. Aldous Huxley's Island. David Graeber's Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology explores ethnographic insights that are relevant to degrowth theory. Then there are the writings of anti-colonial leaders like Gandhi, Fanon and Sankara, who rejected growthism and sought to define a more human-centered economics. These are all resources we can draw on as we imagine a more just and ecological civilization.

\emph{Strategy}

There's a lot of work to be done when it comes to degrowth political strategy. I think what's required is a range of approaches. There are people at the community level working to bring degrowth principles to local economic governance. Transition Towns in the UK are a nascent example of this. So too with cities like Amsterdam and Copenhagen adopting ``doughnut economics''. We can see it at a national level, too, with New Zealand, Scotland and Iceland choosing to abandon GDP growth as a government objective. I think there's hope at a multilateral level, too: the Environment Committee of the European Parliament just recently voted in favour of binding targets to reduce material throughput in absolute terms. That's a core degrowth policy. Of course, it's not law yet -- but it's a huge step.

The difference between neoliberal political strategy and degrowth is that the former had the backing of billionaires and corporations that bankrolled think tanks, university departments, and media outlets. It also had international financial institutions and the US military, which forcibly imposed the Washington Consensus around the world. Degrowth has to rely almost entirely on social movements. That's a tall order, but we can take inspiration from our ancestors: the anti-slavery movement, the anti-apartheid movement, the anti-colonial movement, the Civil Rights Movement, the labour movement, the feminist movement\ldots{} all of these have changed the world, against overwhelming odds. That's the scale of what's required of us.

\chapter{Green Growth}\label{green-growth}}

\begin{quote}
Most people encounter the growth debate, if they encounter it at all, through the idea of ``green growth.'' This is a vision for our collective future based on the belief that technological advance will drastically reduce the amount of raw materials needed to sustain growth---a process known as dematerialization---and ``decouple'' growing GDP from its ecological impacts. As proof that this is not only possible but already happening, boosters of the idea point to the transition by rich countries from manufacturing to service-based economies, as well as efficiency gains in energy and in the use of materials. The process that replaced letters with email, and compact discs with digital files, will continue until we live in a spectral economy where little at all is manufactured or transported, save those things that can be pulled from thin air by, one presumes, solar-powered 3-D printers.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The belief that green growth will save us, also known as ``ecomodernism'' or ``ecopragmatism,'' has become a trendy article of faith among elites who acknowledge climate change and the dangers of breaching ecological boundaries. In 2017, Barack Obama threw his support behind the idea in an article for Science magazine, maintaining that signs of decoupling in major economies ``should put to rest the argument that combatting climate change requires accepting lower growth or a lower standard of living.''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The argument that capitalism can grow itself out of the present crisis may be soothing to those who like the world as it is. It also relies on the kind of accounting tricks and rejection of reality more closely associated with Obama's successor.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
In a growth system, gains in efficiency do not translate to higher wages, greater equality, more leisure, or lower emissions; they are plowed right back into the growth cycle. A classic example of this dynamic is the advent of the chain saw. A person with a chain saw can cut 10 times as many trees in the same time as a person using older methods. Logging companies did not use this invention, however, to shorten the workweek by 90 percent. They used it to cut 10 times more trees than they otherwise would have. ``Lashed by the growth imperative, technology is used not to do the same amount of stuff in less time, but rather to do more stuff in the same amount of time,''
``In a system where technological innovation is leveraged to expand extraction and production, it makes little sense to hope that yet more technological innovation will somehow magically do the opposite.''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Defenders of growth often take cheap shots at degrowthers by painting them as anti-science, anti-progress, and all around a bit woo-woo. But the targets of these attacks are straw men, and emerge from a dangerously outdated view of the world. For starters, there was never any basis for the materialist view of nature as an all-you-can-eat buffet of inert ``resources.'' A number of discoveries across the life and physical sciences have revealed the astounding complexity and cooperation of the systems that support life, from the trillions of microbes that process food in our guts, to planet-scale systems that regulate chemical balances in the atmosphere and oceans. In every field---except, notably, economics---the worldview that allows trees to be seen as timber, and timber as a contributor to GDP, has been overtaken by a second scientific revolution. The picture of the world to emerge from this revolution is both more fragile and more interrelated than the equations found in modern economics textbooks can describe.

SMM: Less Is More includes a really fascinating section on the creation story of capitalism. The story is basically of peasants who threw off the rule of aristocrats and built egalitarian communes that also were quite animistic, with an ecologically-minded relationship to non-human (or your great phrase ``more-than-human'') life. Rulers invented capitalism to basically extract more from the peasant communities and compel farmers to extract more from the land. The takeaway seems to be that in the absence of such psychopathic aristocrats and autocrats, people generally self-organize into more or less eco-anarchist democracies. There are many examples of Indigenous societies incorporating social tools to maintain democratic politics and prevent wealth and power hoarders from taking over. Are there practical mechanisms (that you didn't include in Less Is More) that you'd point to for achieving such enviable accountability in modern fossil states, or do we just need to hope for collapses and fragmentation?

JH: It's worth remembering that the ecological ontologies that characterize many Indigenous communities today are not some kind of timeless trait. They have been formulated in response to capitalism. In most cases these communities, or their ancestors, have had first-hand experience of the violence of colonial capital. They know how destructive it is, to both humans and ecologies, especially on the frontiers of the world-system. Consider the devastation wrought by the European invasion of the Americas, which wiped out 90\% of the population and turned vast tracts of land into plantation monoculture and strip mines. That's the context here. Indigenous communities have seen apocalypse up close, and their ontologies have been formed accordingly, with an acute awareness of the values that are required if we are to thrive together on this planet.

For the first 400 years of its history, capitalism caused immiseration virtually everywhere it went: enclosure, dispossession, genocide, mass enslavement, colonization, famine. It wasn't until 1870 that we began to see any improvement in life expectancy in Europe, and that was the product of the labour movement and related struggles for democracy, municipal socialism, and basic interventions like public sanitation, public housing, and public healthcare. We don't see improvement in the global South until progressive movements succeed in achieving decolonization. This history is important, because it reveals that what's required for progress isn't growth as such (as in, an aggregate expansion in the commodity economy), but rather a fair distribution of income and opportunity, and access to universal public goods. It's not rocket science, but it does require a political struggle. So one might say that degrowth redefines progress. The goal is to achieve well-being for all, in balance with the Earth's ecosystems, and any step we take in this direction (i.e., degrowth) represents progress.

developing country indebtedness, and the enduring gap in support for adaptation, LDCs and SIDS, are grave
concerns. Meeting the \$100bn goal on these terms would be cause for concern, not celebration.
