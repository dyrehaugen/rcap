<h1><span class="header-section-number">21</span> Capital as Power</h1>
<p><img src="fig/power_index.png" /></p>
<p>The capitalization of firms indicates their ‘differential power,’ which is their ability to use property rights to further their own economic advantage over workers and other peer competitors. Dominant classes and corporations exploit this differential power to adjust wages, profits, and prices as they see fit, gaining more power over labor along the way.</p>

<p><em>CasP Theory</em></p>
<p>Power, even when recognized, cannot be integrated into political economy:
(1) it upsets the so-called laws of economics,
(2) it decimates value theory, and
(3) it makes ‘real’ aggregates unquantifiable.</p>
<p>The theory of capital as power (CasP) is radically different from conventional political
economy.
In the conventional view, mainstream as well as heterodox, capital is seen a “real” economic
entity engaged in the production of goods and services, and capitalism is thought of as a
mode of production and consumption. Finance in this approach is either a mere
reflection/lubricant of the real economy (the mainstream view), or a parasitic fiction (the
heterodox perspective).
CasP rejects this framework. Capital, it argues, is not a productive economic entity, but a
symbolic representation of organized societal power writ large, and capitalism should be
analysed not as a mode of production and consumption, but as a mode of power. In this
approach, finance is neither a reflection nor a fiction, but the symbolic language that
organizes and reorders – or creates the order of – capitalized power.</p>
<p>Liberals tend to see this separation in black and white: “economy – good; politics – bad.” And
that’s hardly a caricature. In the liberal cosmology, the economy – namely the processes of
production, consumption, technology, trade, prices and income – is the fertile source of
society. This is the horizontal realm of individualism, utility, productivity, frugality, rationality,
dynamism and freedom, the sphere where personal initiative and mutually beneficial
exchange propel society forward. By contrast, politics – namely the state and its
bureaucracies, the law, the police and army – is the vertical domain of authoritarianism and
conformism, power and coercion, waste and irrationality, corruption and manipulation.</p>
<p>Prone to mischief, politics should be restricted as much as possible. Ideally, its role should be
to assist the economy by providing law and order and filling in for the occasional market
failure – and that’s it. In practice, though, politics always ends up doing more than it is
supposed to, causing havoc in the process. According to liberals, politics as such cannot
produce anything; it can only appropriate and redistribute. And since the economy is assumed
efficient to start with, political intervention cannot but distort and undermine this efficiency,
making the overall economic pie smaller. The obvious antidote for this mishap is laissez faire:
for liberals, the best society is one with the biggest “free” economy and the smallest and least
“interventionist” polity.</p>
<p>The Marxist view is different, but not entirely. Like liberals, Marxists too distinguish economics
from politics (or base from superstructure). And they too see the economy, particularly
production, as the prime mover of capitalism – the sphere where labour creates both the use
value that sustains society and the surplus value that capitalists appropriate to propel
accumulation. Unlike liberals, though, Marxists view the political sphere not as a hindering
distortion, but as a built-in requirement. The formal separation of economics from politics, they
argue, legally alienates private property from public control in order to ensure and legitimize
the class superiority of capitalists over the rest of society. In this way, economics and politics
stand as the two essential pillars of the capitalist regime – the former generates its
exploitation, while the latter secures its oppression.</p>
<p>Although liberals and Marxists reject each
other’s framework, they appear to agree (albeit for different reasons) that economics and
politics are – and must be – distinctly constituted, and that the economy leads with production
and politics reacts with redistribution.</p>
<p>And the question is why? Why do political economists right and left insist on retaining the
anachronistic separation of economics from politics and the notion that the former dominates
the later? You can say that liberal defenders of capitalism benefit from this separation and
prioritization, but what do Marxist critiques of capitalism stand to gain from upholding the
same view? The answer is largely analytical. As they stand, neither school can afford to rock
the boat. Without the a priori separation and pecking order of economics and politics, their
ability to model – and even describe – the social reality breaks down.</p>
<p>Politics must be seen as subservient to economics: if they are not, the
arbitrary character of politics – and of power more generally – is bound to distort if not totally
annul the rational-mathematical automaticity of the perfectly competitive economy; with
mathematical rationality gone, liberals lose their universal laws of the economy and Marxists
their capitalist laws of value, if not of motion; and with these laws defunct, political economy
can no longer claim to be the science of society.</p>

<p>In English, of persons who own a variety of assets that have a certain monetary value,
one says that they have a certain wealth. In English, it is not clear how wealth as such
should relate to power. The situation is different in German: the direct translation of
‘wealth’ is Vermögen, sometimes even Kapitalvermögen. You say, Mr. Gates has a
Vermögen of $100 billion. Now, the word Vermögen is also used more generally to
denote the ability to do something, the power to. Indeed, etymologically Vermögen
belongs to the same group as the German Macht, which is the direct translation of
‘power,’ especially in political contexts. These words trace their etymology to the
Indo-European root mag h , which means ‘ability’ or ‘power,’ and from which all kinds
of related English words, like ‘might,’ ‘mechanics,’ ‘machine’ and many others,
including ‘magician,’ derive; there is also the closely related root maĝ h , which means
‘fight’ or ‘struggle’ (Köbler 2014).
So in German, the identity of capital and power is already built into the language—
and the etymologically English equivalent to Kapitalvermögen would be ‘capital
might.’ The reader can get a feeling for the meaning of Vermögen by taking an
arbitrary report about goings-on in business and replace words like ‘asset,’ ‘wealth’
and ‘equity’ with ‘might.’ The use of the word Vermögen for financial wealth
apparently seems to have started around 1500 (Grimm and Grimm 2019). This was
the age of German protocapitalists, most notably Jacob Fugger of Augsburg (b. 1459–
d. 1525), whose byname was ‘the Rich’ and who, at the end of his life, controlled much
of European silver and copper production, silver being the foundation of the hard
money of the age and copper a raw material necessary for making then new weapons
of mass destruction, cannons and guns. Fugger and other rich men were able to turn
their business success into political influence. For example, Fugger was responsible,
i.e. paid for, Charles V to become emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 1519
(Häberlein 2012; Steinmetz 2016). In an age that was otherwise still feudalist, this
new kind of monetized power, Geldvermögen, was reflected in chapbooks, early
popular printed story books, notably in the well-known Dr. Faustus, about a magician
who seeks power through a pact with the devil, but also in the much less known
Fortunatus, which plays out the possibilities its main character has with a purse that
contains money each time he opens it (Suchsland 1968).</p>

<p><strong>Asymmetric extension of the market</strong></p>
<p>On the face of it, then, an ever-expanding market system – a “still extending order” – would
appear to be good news because it would bring the market’s genuine power of efficient
allocation to more and more items. The key problem, however, is that there is a hazardous
and unsustainable asymmetry in the pattern of the market’s extension.
Consider, for example, that over the last decade my Google search for “carbon emissions”
has been commodified and now commands a price – not to me, but to the advertisers bidding
for my attention – while my actual carbon emissions remain unpriced despite economists
making a serious case for such pricing for nearly half a century, now. Personal data suddenly
has a price, but not carbon emissions? The market seems to extend in mysterious ways.
The simple explanation is that markets appear where those who have power to make markets
would like them to appear.
This power is often de facto rather than explicitly granted. Our current socio-economic
arrangements empower corporations to reach out and appropriate – to make new property of
– new things that may be profitable for them. Such as your internet searches or knowledge of
your travel movements. However, corporations also have extraordinary power through
lobbying and regulatory obstruction to prevent any new commodification of entities that would
result in new costs. Businesses have real powers in the political domain in which markets are
nested to determine where markets may or may not extend.
So, our still extending – and so still incomplete – market system continues to annex new,
previously uncommodified, realms, but in asymmetrical fashion. Markets eagerly reach out to
embrace new profit opportunities but rebuff the internalization of new costs. As the decades
go by, this ensures that the market, as an institution, becomes ever more extractive or cost-
shifting in nature.</p>
<p>“Enabled markets,” not “free markets”
Hence, the “free market” advocate cheats when he argues the role of government is
principally to uphold property rights, or to “enforce private contracts.” That entirely dodges the
critical questions of what entities should receive property rights and how we should
collectively decide. “Property” can never be a static domain, both because we make new
things and because our ever-expanding knowledge of the world leads us to re-perceive and
re-value many existing things. As well, technology permits us to commodify – and so make
property of – more and more.
The “free market” advocate is in the dissonant position of wishing market actors to be the sole
conferees of new property rights while also depending on the government to uphold a general
rule of law which is the necessary condition for property to being meaningful at all. Indeed,
because of the indispensability of the rule of law, we should be more accurate with our
terminology. We never have “free markets.” We only ever have “enabled markets” – markets
enabled by an authority capable of upholding the rule of law that gives property meaning.
Language matters. “Free markets” is a highly misleading term – routinely deployed as an
unassailable universal principle to cloak a more parochial agenda. Too often, what “free
market” proponents are really advocating is a system of “enabled markets where we want
them and not where we don’t.” Or, put another way, the working slogan of neoliberalism has
come to be: “some markets are the solution; government is the problem.”</p>
<p>Government is in the loop!
The problem, as should now be clear, is that we have created a narrative and cultural norms
that limit governments’ ability to correct the huge gaps in the market’s grasp of real value. We
expect government to support the market and governments now find themselves “caught in
the loop” of promoting unsustainable economic growth.
Governments increasingly use economic performance – even stock market performance! – as
a measure of their success, which negates their ability or even interest to introduce new
markets that may impose costs. Other reinforcing loops are more tangible, still. For example,
corporations use profits to lobby for lax regulations that enhance profits which can be used to
lobby for more lax regulations etc. This dynamic – Friedman’s Feedback Loop, call it – has
inexorably neutered government’s ability to improve human welfare by modulating market
forces</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">21.1</span> Commodities vs Assets</h2>
<p><em>Fix on Cherizola</em></p>
<p>Suaste Cherizola explores a puzzle in political economy — the neglect of assets. Why, he asks, do most radical political economists focus on commodities, when capitalists themselves care about assets?</p>
<p><a href="https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2021/05/03/jesus-suaste-cherizola-wins-the-2021-casp-essay-prize/">Fix on Cherizola</a></p>
<p><em>Cherizola Abstract</em></p>
<p>Assets are a crucial concept of the practice and mindset of the capitalist class. Critical analyses of capitalism, however, tend to admit that the exchange of commodities is the foundation of the analysis of capitalism. This article takes a different approach. I claim that assets offer a solid starting point for a scientific research of capitalism. The analysis of assets allows us to elaborate a general description of economic transactions and, to that extent, it lays the groundwork for reconceptualizing the field of finance. These two issues are closely related. The answer to the question, ‘what are assets?’ will give us the coordinates to address the question: ‘what is finance?’</p>
<p><em>Cherizola Memo</em></p>
<p>Certainly, finance is an enigmatic domain. Finance is not production, but it
seems to be involved in every aspect of it. The so called ‘financial economy’ is
usually defined in opposition to a ‘productive,’ ‘material’ or ‘real’ economy. This
seems to imply, however, that the financial realm is unproductive, immaterial
and even non-real. Financial signs seem too ethereal to be considered the basis
of capitalism. But they seem too powerful to be considered a ‘mere reflection’
of production.</p>
<p>What are assets made of? How can they turn a
group of individuals into a ruling class?</p>
<p>A remarkable fact about assets is the little interest they receive from radical
thinkers, who instead have devoted thousands of pages to the analysis of com-
modities. This is even more surprising if we consider that capitalists act in the
exact opposite way: commodities do not seem to concern them, while assets
receive all their attention.</p>
<p>There is an entire academic discipline — finance —
dedicated to the study of assets or, more precisely, to interpreting the world as
an immense repository of actual or potential assets.
The exclusive
object of the ruling class: all members of society interact with commodities, but
only the capitalists structure their relation with the world through assets.</p>
<p>Commodities originate from the hands of the workers, while assets spring from
the minds of capitalists.</p>
<p>The proliferation of entities that have a price
without having value represents a major challenge for the alleged sovereignty
of the law of value. Under contemporary capitalism, as financial operations
extend their territory, and as the production of commodities seems to be more
and more subordinated to the financial dynamics, the law of value loses con-
trol over the economic system, and the world assumes the form of an immense,
unintelligible distortion. The law of value is nowhere and the ‘irrational expres-
sions’ become reality itself.</p>
<p>I argue first that assets can only be defined as <em>sets of faculties</em> that are socially
sanctioned. In other words, assets are <em>entitlements</em>. Second, I argue that
entitlements are the actual object exchanged in an economic transaction.</p>
<pre><code>All assets have these two components: an owner and a set of terms that specify what the owner is entitled to do

For the owner, an asset specifies a set of rights. For the subjects that validate it, an asset is a set of orders.

The performative power of an asset from the will of the subjects committed to enforcing it.

The market is the system in which sets of rights/orders receive a price and are exchanged according to a unit of account called money.</code></pre>
<p><em>Ownership</em>, indeed, is a type
of relation that goes from a subject that ‘tells,’ to a community that ‘believes.’
Saying and believing are the two parts that, as we saw, constitute assets: a
subject that claims and a community that abides.</p>
<p>To understand the ontological features of ownership, it must be clearly distin-
guished from a closely related phenomenon: <em>possession</em>. Possession designates
a physical relation between a subject and a thing. Ownership designates a
symbolic relation between human beings.</p>
<p>Generally, the owner of a commodity also becomes its possessor — the benefi-
ciary of the use-value of the commodity.</p>
<p>It is the owner who is entitled
to activate the social procedures that protect private property</p>
<p>A framework aiming to describe all economic
transactions must replace the fictional stories of commodity holders with the
study of entitled owners.</p>
<p>Assets must be capable of
being stored and presented in some way.</p>
<p>All economic transactions are transformations at the level of ownership.</p>
<p>From this point of view, the claim that markets allo-
cate resources is misleading. If the object of economic transactions are
symbolic entitlements, what the market allocates is power — and only
because it allocates power, it has consequences on the physical distribu-
tion of the world.</p>
<p>Since assets have performative power and a monetary value, we can define
them as units of capitalized power.</p>
<p>Capitalized power is the system through which the ruling class sustains and
reorganizes (in a word: creorders) social reality.
Assets are the units of the
capitalist mode of power. Capital is the virtual structure in which assets exist.
And assets are the particular entities in which capital actualizes.</p>
<p>Capitalization is the elementary algorithm of capitalism.</p>
<p>Understanding finance as a code — a social programming language — allows
us to recognize its performative dimension. Like any other language (musi-
cal language, architectural language, or written language) financial language
makes possible the emergence of new forms of interaction between individu-
als.
Make it
possible for large groups of human beings to coordinate with a precision and
on a scale that would be unattainable if that language did not exist. These
signs add an irreducible difference to the set of social practices in which they
are involved.</p>
<p>Capitalization makes it possible for large
groups of human beings — the capitalist class — to coordinate with a precision
and on a scale that would be unattainable if that language did not exist.</p>
<p>nominal entities constitute an emergent property of social real-
ity. Their existence generates unique and irreducible dynamics. Finance does
not produce the world, but it does organize the world of those who inhabit it:
it provides the code in which capitalists plan and execute the process of capital
accumulation; the code through which capitalists command and workers obey;
it organizes productive processes under the double imperative of accumulating
capital and retaining control over society. Financial signs do
not merely interpret the world, they change it.</p>
<p>Assets do something at least as relevant as the production of things: they allocate
the power of deciding what will be produced. Financial activities are ‘produc-
tive’ in the sense that they reproduce and reshape power relations.
Production is ultimately governed by the ownership of assets.
Assets do not produce commodities: they give orders to those who do.</p>
<p>Without finance, there is no accumulation of capital.</p>
<p>Accumulation of capital (as any other mode of power) is both a symbolic
and a material process: power is exercised over the world and the bodies of
subjects, but the financial code organizes and reshapes the power relations
among human beings.</p>
<p>The object of study of a theory of accumulation of capital is not the
production of commodities but the reproduction of power.</p>
<p>Finance is the code of the capitalist mode of power — the social pro-
gramming language with which the capitalist class reshapes society and
controls the process of social reproduction. The fact that assets and other
financial entities are ‘symbolic’ does not make them fictions: they are
the conceptual instruments of a power technology.</p>
<p>We no longer have to ask
how the real economy is connected to the financial economy because,
first of all, that separation does not exist. What does exist is the power
to allocate resources through the ownership and transfer of entitlements.
By abandoning the idea that there is a ‘real economy,’ we can concentrate
on studying the ‘real domination.’</p>
<p>Assets are the units of capitalized power. Capital is the virtual structure
that makes the existence of assets possible. But capital only exists in and
through the assets that ‘actualize’ it.</p>
<p>Capitalists can afford to produce more or produce less. But they cannot
afford to let the value of their assets fall. To understand what makes
the value of assets increase (or decrease) is to understand what capital
accumulation consists of.</p>
